<P>
We have developed a Python replacement for the command language used in
IRAF, the most widely used data analysis software system in astronomy.
The new system allows access to the hundreds of data analysis tasks in
the IRAF system, retains the package and parameter structures currently
used in IRAF, handles the graphics output and image display
interactions, and is capable of completely emulating the old scripting
language by translating it into Python. We expect the new language to
become widely used in astronomy because it combines access to the
familiar suite of IRAF tasks with a more powerful programming language
that is also capable of manipulating data directly through the NumPy
module. This paper describes the problems we faced, the solutions we
have adopted, and our future plans. The entire project has been much
easier than we anticipated, due largely to the excellent facilities
provided by the Python language and user community.
</P>

<P><B>1. Introduction</B></P>

<P>
The most widely used data analysis software in the astronomical
community is a system called the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility
(IRAF) [Tody84]. It is estimated that approximately half of astronomers
use IRAF regularly. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) has
used IRAF as the basis of all the software it has developed for
calibration and analysis of Hubble Space Telescope data. While IRAF has
proved a durable environment for software development and has a number
of positive aspects that are particularly useful for astronomical data
analysis software, it is becoming increasingly outmoded.
</P>

<P>
One approach to updating our software environment would be to find or
develop a completely new software system. Unfortunately this would
require rewriting a great number of applications already developed
under IRAFsome million lines of code in which hundreds of man-years are
invested. Starting from scratch is considered untenable due to both the
effort required to replace the existing applications and the time
required to produce a critical mass of applications sufficient to
attract astronomers to the new system. Any effort to transform our
analysis environment must be evolutionary in nature and must retain the
ability to run the vast majority of applications developed to date.
This paper describes how we are using Python to do just that.
</P>

<P><B>2. IRAF and Data Analysis in the Astronomical Community</B></P>

<P>
Understanding the nature of the problem and the solution we have chosen
requires some explanation of the IRAF system and the nature of data
reduction and analysis in astronomy. One of the fundamental goals of
the IRAF system was to allow astronomical applications to be developed
in a portable way that would make it easy to distribute the software to
astronomers worldwide. Typically astronomers take data at telescope
facilities far from their home institutions. Understandably, most
astronomers would like to reduce and analyze their data at their home
institution rather than remaining at the observatory. Since there are
many aspects of calibration, data reduction and analysis common to most
astronomical data, it makes sense to have widely distributed
applications rather than to expect astronomers to code all their data
analysis applications (which was the common approach before IRAF was
developed.)
</P>

<P>
Distributing software to a diverse set of computing platforms is still
a thorny problem; it was a thornier problem at the time the IRAF system
was designed (19791984). The IRAF design was primarily centered around
allowing easy portability for applications while retaining the ability
to write computationally efficient programs. IRAF solved this problem
quite well. Programs written in the IRAF system port fantastically
easily. Applications virtually never require platform specific code;
there are rarely any problems building or running such applications on
supported platforms. As long as the IRAF system has been ported to your
computing platform you can have great confidence that the applications
software written for IRAF will work fine on it (well, aside from the
bugs that plague software in generalthese are platform-independent
bugs!)
</P>

<P>
This portability comes at a cost, however. Two major choices were made
to ensure portability. One was that IRAF would provide a virtual
operating system interface to applications. All applications are
required to use only the virtual operating system interface. This
interface provides access to all the usual system services such as file
and terminal I/O, process control, and signal handling. The second
choice was to require IRAF programs to be written in a special
language. It was judged at the time that no existing language was
sufficiently portable, had the necessary system features (such as
memory allocation), and was efficient enough for numerical computation.
Consequently, the designer of IRAF chose to implement a new language
(called SPP) that the IRAF system ultimately translates into FORTRAN
66. This language, which combines elements of FORTRAN and C, was until
recently the only language having access to the full functionality of
the system libraries for applications. Virtually all of the application
</P>

<P>
While these choices did meet the goal of portability, they entail
drawbacks that are becoming more painful as time goes on. The decision
to provide a virtual OS interface commits the maintainer of the system
to the heavy burden of maintaining many aspects of an OS with far fewer
resources than are usually available to those that are responsible for
such systems. Adding the new capabilities that are found in other
current systems is even more difficult. The net result has been that
IRAF has lagged behind the features and capabilities commonly expected
in new OS's and applications. Worse, the design makes it very difficult
to integrate outside libraries and applications because of the
requirement that all code use the provided virtual OS interface. It is
an extremely closed system.
</P>

<P>
Finally, the use of a custom language that lacks many of the features
found in more modern languagesparticularly object-oriented featureshas
obvious problems. Programmers using it often feel that they are not
learning marketable skills, and they do not get the productivity
benefits seen in newer, standard languages. Most troubling of all is
the large code base that cannot be easily moved into any other
environment without a complete rewrite.
</P>

<P><B>2. Desired Changes</B></P>

<P>
Many areas of the IRAF system could either be improved or replaced to
make it more open to use with other software. One step in this
direction at STScI was the generation of bindings that allow writing
IRAF programs in C. This at least allows us to program in a standard
language, although the dependence on the virtual OS interface still
presents many barriers to integrating IRAF software with other
software.
</P>

<P>
We decided that the next most important improvement would be to develop
an alternate "shell" for the IRAF system. The IRAF system has its own
"Command Language" (CL) which is effectively its virtual OS shell. From
this CL, one can run IRAF tasks, perform file operations, get directory
listings, print files, etc. Scripts can be written in the CL, and as
such it is also a scripting language. But it has many limitations, not
least of which is that it has no error or exception handling. This
makes writing robust, complex scripts difficult, if not impossible.
</P>

<P>
If we could replace the existing IRAF CL with a more capable shell
environment, we would reap some important benefits. We could write
significantly more powerful and robust scripts, so many tasks that now
must be developed as C programs could be instead written in the
scripting language. We could develop GUI interfaces much more easily.
(Writing GUI tasks in IRAF is now possible, but they are both tedious
to develop and difficult to maintain.) Perhaps most importantly, we
could integrate non-IRAF tasks and libraries with IRAF far more easily,
allowing the addition of new capabilities to the system.
</P>

<P>
Writing a good scripting language is a lot of work and is hard to
justify if a good, general purpose, extensible language already exists.
Thus our interest in Python.
</P>

<P>
Given the limitations of IRAF just described, how would it be possible
to do what we have outlined? After all, if it is difficult to link in
outside programs because of the virtual OS restrictions, why would we
be able to do it with Python? The reason is that the CL environment
need not be directly linked with the IRAF virtual OS. Almost all IRAF
applications run as sub-processes of the CL and communicate with the CL
through stdin and stdout pipes. This is not to say that handling the
tasks is simple, but the fact that the CL communicates with tasks
through pipes instead of through an OS-based link makes the problem
tractable. The problem reduces to creating a scripting environment that
emulates the task communication protocol, so that the applications
believe they are running in the old CL environment.
</P>

<P>
For a new CL environment to successfully run the existing applications
in a convenient way, the following problems must be solved:
</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
The environment must start up the application executables as
sub-processes and communicate with them through pipes following a
special protocol. This protocol multiplexes several I/O streams from
the application (stdout, stderr, graphics, etc.) onto one set of
input/output pipes. The new environment must de-multiplex the various
I/O streams and must properly manage the sub-process (including sending
appropriate environment information, initiating the execution of one of
several tasks in an executable, responding to task requests for
parameters, handling interrupts and errors, etc.) The entire process is
rather complicated.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Applications (tasks) in IRAF are organized in a hierarchical set of
packages, each of which may contain any number of tasks or packages
(similar to a directory tree.) CL scripts are used to define the
hierarchical structure of these packages, with a package script
indicating where the executable for each task can be found (an
executable may contain multiple task entry points) and where the next
level of package scripts can be found. A new environment must be able
to traverse the package tree from the existing CL scripts, because
replicating the dynamic package structure information would be
error-prone and time-consuming.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
The CL environment manages the parameters controlling the tasks. Each
task usually has an associated parameter file which defines the names
of parameters, their types, default values, enumerated values or ranges
for each parameter, and prompt strings. Parameter values are persistent
between task invocations (and, in fact, between IRAF sessions); this
turns out to be very convenient for typical data analysis sessions. The
CL itself reads the parameter files and interacts with the user to
change current values. A new CL environment must be able to find the
parameter files, read and interpret them properly, apply the
appropriate type and range constraints, and respond to the tasks
requests for parameter values.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
The CL also manages the graphics that any task produces. All graphics
produced by task's result in a metacode stream of simple graphics
instructions to the CL. The CL must determine which device the graphics
are destined for and translate the metacode into device-specific
graphics instructions.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
The CL manages the interactions between the task and image display
programs. A number of tasks request the position of an image cursor
along with a keystroke character value to determine what action the
task should take (i.e., interactive responses). The CL must be able to
communicate with standard astronomical image display programs (e.g.,
ximtool and saoimage) using their specialized protocol.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
A few tasks may request arbitrary CL commands to be executed.
Replicating this behavior essentially requires emulating the old CL
completely.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Many "tasks" are actually implemented as CL scripts. Retaining access
to their functionality requires either rewriting them in the new
scripting language or, again, emulating the old CL.
</LI>
</P>

</UL>

<P>
In short, to be able to create a new CL, one must be able to perform
the above functions or sacrifice some capabilities. Whichever tool is
used to implement a new CL must be capable of sub-process creation,
communication, and management; it must be powerful enough to parse and
emulate the old CL syntax and semantics. It must be able to interpret a
graphics metacode stream and render graphics; it must provide all the
necessary capabilities to communicate with image display programs and
handle user interactions; and it must be able to do so quickly and
without great implementation effort.
</P>

<P>
As if this weren't enough to ask, we required even more. The new system
must interface easily with existing C code, and it must have a usable
interactive environment for astronomers, many of prefer to interact
with tasks by using a simple shell-like syntax (e.g., space-delimited
argument lists with quotes optional on strings). Another design
consideration is portability. Although IRAF has been ported to a number
of platforms, all the supported platforms are Unix variants (with the
exception of VMS, which will soon be unsupported). Aspects of the new
CL system are necessarily Unix-specific, since without a Windows or Mac
port of IRAF, we do not know how the specific mechanisms will work on
those operating systems. For example, one needs to know how IRAF will
implement process communications and fork functionality, which could
use several different approaches on Windows. Even so, we desire that
the non-IRAF enhancements to the new CL be portable to other platforms
even if IRAF is not yet implemented on them.
</P>

<P>
Finally, and perhaps most important, a key element in making a new CL
environment more powerful is providing access to powerful and efficient
numerical array operations. While IRAF is the most widely used
astronomical data reduction and analysis facility, a substantial
fraction of astronomers use the array-based language IDL to write
reduction and analysis tasks. IDL (Interactive Data Language, <A
HREF="http://www.rsinc.com/">http://www.rsinc.com/</A>) has proven very
useful in the astronomical context, and many astronomers swear by it.
But it is expensive and lacking as a general programming language.
Currently, the IRAF CL has essentially none of the data manipulation
facilities that make IDL so attractive. On the other hand, it is
difficult to write integrated, high-level applications in IDL that are
competitive with those in IRAF, and running IRAF tasks from IDL is next
to impossible. Neither is easy to integrate with the other.
</P>

<P>
We would like the new CL that we are developing to integrate the
powerful, interactive, array and graphics capabilities that make
prototyping new scientific analysis algorithms so easy in IDL with the
existing suite of fully developed IRAF applications that can handle
many common (but difficult) data analysis problems.
</P>

<P><B>4. Using Python as the New Environment for IRAF</B></P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.1 Requirements for underlying scripting language</P></B>

<P>
When searching for the appropriate tool to implement a new CL, Python
looked like a likely candidate. The existing set of libraries and code,
along with the ability to easily interface with C programs, led us to
believe that it might be possible to implement much of the CL in
Python. NumPy looked like a very promising basis on which to provide
array-based analysis features. Still, Python is not unique in this
regard. We also required that the language: (1) had a wide enough user
base to expect that it would be around for a while, (2) provided good
support for object-oriented programming, and, most important, (3) was
readable enough for many astronomers to feel that it was a programming
language that they could use. In this regard, Python stood out as a
clear choice. Nevertheless, it still was not clear that replacing the
IRAF CL with Python was feasible.
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.2 Python made it much easier than expected</P></B>

<P>
As it turned out, we needn't have worried. We have been able to
implement a new CL with far less effort than we expected using Python.
Over the span of one year, we have implemented all the major
functionality required, including nearly complete emulation of the old
CL. Virtually all our development has been done in the Python language
itself without any serious performance problems. The basic system was
developed with approximately a total combined effort of 6 man-months.
The following will broadly indicate the tools we used to implement the
new CL.
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.3 Sub-process control &amp; communication</P></B>

<P>
We use the subproc module (available from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/contrib">ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/contrib</A>)
as a basis for the control of the IRAF applications running as
sub-processes. While some modifications were necessary, we have been
able to use it to reliably control the IRAF executables. We have used
NumPy in a few areas to convert between IRAF 16-bit characters and
ASCII, and to handle IRAF 16-bit data transfers (e.g., graphics
metacode).
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.4 Graphics</P></B>

<P>
PyOpenGL was used to implement a graphics kernel that renders the IRAF
graphics metacode in Tkinter (Togl) widgets. We are currently exploring
the possibility of using wxPython as an alternative to Tkinter.
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.5 Task objects</P></B>

<P>
IRAF tasks are represented as Python objects. A task object embodies
the specific information needed to actually execute the task. Such
objects are created when IRAF packages are loaded in the Python
environment (with lazy instantiation used for some attributes to avoid
excessive initialization costs.) Packages are also represented as task
objects and, when executed, load the tasks and packages contained
within the package by creating new task objects.
</P>

<P>
The task object's <TT>__call__</TT> method has been
defined to allow execution of the task when the task object is called
as a function. Both positional and keyword arguments are supported; in
keeping with the IRAF CL style, parameters defined as "hidden" are
accessible only as keyword arguments. Unambiguous abbreviations are
also allowed for keyword names.
</P>

<P>
Currently we have a few different alternatives for the namespaces in
which the task objects appear. In one case they appear in the main
namespace, in another they appear in the <TT>iraf</TT> module
namespace. We expect to settle on a standard approach to namespaces
after some experience using the system.
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.6 Task parameters</P></B>

<P>
IRAF tasks usually have parameter files that specify the names of
parameters for the tasks along with their types, allowable values,
default or current values, and prompt strings. We decided to map these
parameter names to task attributes, with a few twists. Assigning to a
parameter attribute changes the parameter value, but it is important to
prevent a typo in the parameter name from creating a new attribute
rather than changing the value of the intended parameter. We use
<TT>__setattr__</TT> to prevent such errors. We also allow name
completion on parameter attributes (so a parameter name can be
abbreviated to an unambiguous shorter string) using suitable
modifications of <TT>__setattr__</TT> and <TT>__getattr__</TT>.
Finally, when a parameter attribute is assigned a value, the type and
value are checked to insure they conform to the parameter definition.
</P>

<P>
A GUI parameter editor (using file browsers, choice lists for
parameters with enumerated values, integrated help, etc.) has been
written using Tkinter.
</P>

<P>
When a task is executed, defaults for all omitted parameters come from
the persistent values read from the parameter file or set by the user
before running the task. Python has the flexibility to allow
parameter-setting mechanisms that are very similar to those provided by
the IRAF CL, making use of the new task and parameter interface easy
for current IRAF users.
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.7 Emulation of the IRAF CL</P></B>

<P>
The old CL was emulated by using Aycock's "little languages" framework
[Aycock98] to translate CL code to Python. The Python code can be
either saved as source code or compiled and executed in Python. Indeed,
we now have a system that will accept CL commands in exactly the same
syntax as the original as well in Python syntax. While this particular
parsing module may not be the fastest available (though it is quite
elegant and powerful, and we have made a few improvements to make it
faster), its speed is not viewed as a serious problem. The one-time
cost of translating previously untranslated IRAF CL scripts to Python
is acceptable because the resulting Python code can easily be saved for
future use via a combination of pickle and shelve.
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.8 Front-end interpreter</P></B>

<P>
We have developed a front end for the Python interpreter to permit use
of a simple alternate syntax as well as provide many of the
conveniences expected by IRAF users (described below). The alternate
syntax is blended with normal Python by keying off a task dictionary.
If the user types a line beginning with an identifier followed by a
space and more identifiers or expressions (the first cannot start with
parentheses, to make distinguishing Python function calls easier), then
the initial identifier is looked up in the task dictionary (using the
minimum matching capability mentioned later). If it is found, then the
line is interpreted as being in the old CL syntax. Otherwise, it is
treated as Python syntax (subject to the modifications mentioned
below).
</P>

<P>
In this way, if the user types something like
</P>

<P>
<TT>imcopy infile oufile</TT>
</P>

<P>
then the task <TT>imcopy</TT> is found in the dictionary of currently
loaded tasks and the command is translated into
</P>

<P>
<TT>iraf.imcopy("infile","outfile")</TT>
</P>

<P>
and fed to the Python interpreter. Of course, this mechanism prevents
use of a whole class of legal Python statements, but we judged that
there were simple ways of duplicating the "shadowed" Python syntax. For
example, if one defines a variable
</P>

<P>
<TT>imcopy = "just a simple string"</TT>
</P>

<P>
then one cannot type interactively
</P>

<P>
<TT>imcopy</TT>
</P>

<P>
and expect to see the string printed. But the workaround is simple:
<TT>print imcopy</TT>.
</P>

<P>
The tasks that can be invoked using the command-style syntax are not
limited to IRAF applications. We have generalized the task interface to
cover Python functions as well. One can register a Python function as a
task to be included in the task dictionary, and then it can be invoked
in much the same way with a similar parameter interface. Such
registration requires indicating the parameter types expected by the
Python function. Then each argument is checked to see if it conforms to
the task parameter type specifications and an exception is raised if it
cannot be coerced properly. This alleviates the need for type and value
checking in the Python functions.
</P>

<P>
Other interactive conveniences provided by the front-end interpreter
include:
</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>A convenient mechanism for shell escapes:
<TT>!ls *.*</TT></LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Command logging. While an alternate syntax is allowedthe "command"
stylethe statements logged to the file are the translated
representation, so the file can be used as a Python script.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Basic file and directory utilities, i.e., directory listings, file
renaming, copying, deletion, and printing; creating and removing
directories; searching for strings in files, etc. These suffice for the
most common file manipulations.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
I/O redirection and piping <I>a la</I> the Unix shell.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Task name abbreviations. Any unambiguous abbreviation can be used in
place of the full names.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Use of "<TT>{</TT>" and "<TT>}</TT>"
as an alternate statement blocking mechanism (GASP!). This is available
in interactive mode only (what is logged is the equivalent indented
source). Its provides a convenient way of typing a multiple-statement
block on a single line, making for easy command line recall.
</LI>
</P>

</UL>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.9 Non-Python code</P></B>

<P>
The only C code required fell into two categories. A small number of
specialized Xlib utilities were needed to handle window functions not
supplied with Tk (such as focus setting to the original terminal window
and cursor warping). A wrapper was created for an existing C library
that provides functions to communicate with image display programs used
in astronomy [Fitzpatrick97].
</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.10 Summary</P></B>

<P>
The net result of our efforts is a new environment that allows one to
run nearly all IRAF tasks from Python, including setting up an
environment for IRAF tasks and locating packages, executables and
parameter files from the existing IRAF installation.
</P>

<P>
The new CL, which we have tentatively dubbed <I>Pyraf</I>, is now
available to all users at STScI and is being beta tested at a few
outside sites. We plan to release it to the general community in summer
of 2000. Like all our previous software, it will be freely available
including the source code. While most of the code is only of interest
to IRAF users, some of it (the parameter interface, improvements to
subproc and Aycock's framework, and the front-end interpreter) may be
useful for other Python projects.
</P>

<P><B>5. Future Work</B></P>

<P>
While we have made great progress, this is only the first in a series
of steps to provide astronomers with greater data analysis and
reduction capabilities. The existing functionality basically only
replicates the existing IRAF functionality and, by itself, will not
spur many users to switch unless they have a critical need for the
enhanced programming environment that Python provides. A number of
future developments are also essential for widespread acceptance of the
new Python CL environment by the astronomical community.
</P>

<P>
<B>Develop new Pyraf applications at STScI that provide functionality not
available in the current IRAF CL.</B>
We have already started two such projects.
</P>

<P>
<B>Demonstrate the ability to write useful GUI applications far more
easily than is possible to do in IRAF alone.</B>
We have already started such a project.
</P>

<P>
<B>Provide enhancements to the interactive environment that make using
IRAF tasks easier than the current IRAF CL.</B>
We have already included a few minor improvements: for example, it is
now possible to have multiple plotting windows and to recall old plots,
and the GUI parameter editor is easier to use than the existing IRAF
editor.
</P>

<P>
<B>Add IDL-like data manipulation functionality to the Pyraf environment.</B>
To a certain extent, this already exists in NumPy, but both generic and
IRAF-specific enhancements are needed. Major items include:
</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
The means to read and write data in common astronomical disk formats to
NumPy arrays. This is under development as part of the PyFITS module
[Barrett98]. Even more useful would be a mechanism to pass NumPy arrays
directly to IRAF tasks, which would probably require changes to the
IRAF system.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Plotting and image display facilities at the level provided by IDL and
other similar software. At this writing (November 1999), Python is not
quite there. There are a number of scientific plotting packages
available in Python but none satisfies the requirement that it be
freely available, portable, and sufficiently powerful. (As an aside,
astronomical data analysis generally has had little demand for advanced
3-D visualization tools; the great majority of astronomers are quite
happy with 2-D graphics.) Recent progress with Piddle and Graphite
[Strout99] gives us some optimism that these will form the basis for a
good astronomical plotting suite.
</LI>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>
Enhance NumPy's basic functionality to make it equivalent to (or better
than!) IDL, Matlab, and other array languages. Astronomers deal with
large arrays (newer instruments are generating 8K x 8K pixel images).
Efficient use of memory and efficient standard functions are musts when
handling such large images. Currently it is difficult to write NumPy
programs that retain data in 16-bit or single precision floating point
format without automatic up-casting to larger data types. Lack of
gather/scatter capability and efficient intrinsic functions is another
problem (there is no efficient histogram function for example). We know
that others are working to remedy these problems, and we are also
planning to contribute effort to improving NumPy.
</LI>
</P>
</UL>

<P>
<B>Make the software easy to distribute and install.</B>
The problem is not so much with the programs we write; the Python code
we develop will be trivial to install, and there is not much C code so
it also should not present a serious problem. The difficulty is in
having users install all the extensions that are necessary to run our
software.  Users must install Python itself (with the necessary modules
enabled such as fcntl). They also need to install PyOpenGL and related
extensions, which is more troublesome. We're aware that much work is
going on in the distutils SIG to unify the installation process for
extension modules, and we eagerly look forward to the fruits of that
work. But at this time, we consider it needlessly painful to install
the required software.
