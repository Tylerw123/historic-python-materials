<H4>Abstract</H4>

<P>This paper describes the primative methods underlying the implementation
of SQL query evaluation in Gadfly 2, a database management system implemented
in Python [Van Rossum]. The major design goals behind
the architecture described here are to simplify the implementation
and to permit flexible and efficient extensions to the gadfly
engine. Using this architecture and its interfaces programmers
can add functionality to the engine such as alternative disk based
indexed table implementations, dynamic interfaces to remote data
bases or or other data sources, and user defined computations.</P>

<H4>Backgrounder</H4>

The term "database" usually refers to a persistent
collection of data.  Data is persistent if it continues
to exist whether or not it is associated with a running
process on the computer, or even if the computer is
shut down and restarted at some future time.  Database
management systems provide support for constructing databases,
maintaining databases, and extracting information from databases.
<P>
Relational databases manipulate and store persistent
table structures called relations, such as the following
three tables
<P>

 -- drinkers who frequent bars (this is a comment)

The relational model for database structures makes
the simplifying assumption that all data in a database
can be represented in simple table structures
such as these.  Although this assumption seems extreme
it provides a good foundation for defining solid and
well defined database management systems and some
of the most successful software companies in the
world, such as Oracle, Sybase, IBM, and Microsoft,
have marketed database management systems based on
the relational model quite successfully.
<P>
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
The SQL language defines industry standard
mechanisms for creating, querying, and modified
relational tables. Several years ago SQL was one
of many Relational Database Management System
(RDBMS) query languages in use, and many would
argue not the best on. Now, largely due 
to standardization efforts and the
backing of IBM, SQL is THE standard way to talk
to database systems.
<P>
There are many advantages SQL offers over other
database query languages and alternative paradigms
at this time (please see [O'Neill] or [Korth and Silberschatz] 
for more extensive discussions and comparisons between the 
SQL/relational approach and others.)
<P>
The chief advantage over all contenders at this time
is that SQL and the relational model are now widely
used as interfaces and back end data stores to many
different products with different performance characteristics,
user interfaces, and other qualities: Oracle, Sybase,
Ingres, SQL Server, Access, Outlook,
Excel, IBM DB2, Paradox, MySQL, MSQL, POSTgres, and many
others.  For this reason a program designed to use
an SQL database as its data storage mechanism can
easily be ported from one SQL data manager to another,
possibly on different platforms.  In fact the same
program can seamlessly use several backends and/or
import/export data between different data base platforms
with trivial ease.
No other paradigm offers such flexibility at the moment.
<P>
Another advantage which is not as immediately
obvious is that the relational model and the SQL
query language are easily understood by semi-technical
and non-technical professionals, such as business
people and accountants.  Human resources managers
who would be terrified by an object model diagram
or a snippet of code that resembles a conventional
programming language will frequently feel quite at
ease with a relational model which resembles the
sort of tabular data they deal with on paper in
reports and forms on a daily basis.  With a little training the
same HR managers may be able to translate the request
"Who are the drinkers who like bud and frequent cheers?"
into the SQL query
<PRE>
    select drinker
    from frequents
    where bar='cheers'
      and drinker in (
          select drinker
          from likes
          where beer='bud')
</PRE>
(or at least they have some hope of understanding
the query once it is written by a technical person
or generated by a GUI interface tool).  Thus the use
of SQL and the relational model enables communication
between different communities which must understand
and interact with stored information. In contrast
many other approaches cannot be understood easily
by people without extensive programming experience.
</P>
Furthermore the declarative nature of SQL
lends itself to automatic query optimization,
and engines such as Gadfly can automatically translate a user query
into an optimized query plan which takes
advantage of available indices and other data characteristics.
In contrast more navigational techniques require the application
program itself to optimize the accesses to the database and
explicitly make use of indices.
<P>
While it must be admitted that there are application
domains such as computer aided engineering design where
the relational model is unnatural, it is also important
to recognize that for many application domains (such
as scheduling, accounting, inventory, finance, personal
information management, electronic mail) the relational
model is a very natural fit and the SQL query language
make most accesses to the underlying data (even sophisticated
ones) straightforward.  For an example of a moderately
sophisticated query using the tables given above, 
the following query lists the drinkers who frequent lolas bar
and like at least two beers not served by lolas
<pre>
    select f.drinker
    from frequents f, likes l
    where f.drinker=l.drinker and f.bar='lolas'
      and l.beer not in
       (select beer from serves where bar='lolas')
    group by f.drinker
    having count(distinct beer)&gt;=2
</pre>
yielding the result
<pre>
    DRINKER
    =======
    norm   
</pre>
Experience shows that queries of this sort are actually
quite common in many applications, and are often much more
difficult to formulate using some navigational database
organizations, such as some "object oriented" database
paradigms.
<P>
Certainly,
SQL does not provide all you need to interact with
databases -- in order to do "real work" with SQL you
need to use SQL and at least one other language
(such as C, Pascal, C++, Perl, Python, TCL, Visual Basic
or others) to do work (such as readable formatting a report
from raw data) that SQL was not designed to do.

<H4>Why Gadfly 1?</H4>

<P>Gadfly 1.0 is an SQL based relational database implementation
implemented entirely in the Python programming language, with
optional fast data structure accellerators implemented in the
C programming language. Gadfly is relatively small, highly portable,
very easy to use (especially for programmers with previous experience
with SQL databases such as MS Access or Oracle), and reasonably
fast (especially when the kjbuckets C accellerators are used).
For moderate sized problems Gadfly offers a fairly complete
set of features such as transaction semantics, failure recovery,
and a TCP/IP based client/server mode (Please see [Gadfly] for
detailed discussion).


<H4>Why Gadfly 2?</H4>

<P>Gadfly 1.0 also has significant limitations. An active Gadfly
1.0 database keeps all data in (virtual) memory, and hence a Gadfly
1.0 database is limited in size to available virtual memory. Important
features such as date/time/interval operations, regular expression
matching and other standard SQL features are not implemented in
Gadfly 1.0. The optimizer and the query evaluator perform optimizations
using properties of the equality predicate but do not optimize
using properties of inequalities such as BETWEEN or less-than.
It is possible to add &quot;extension views&quot; to a Gadfly
1.0 database, but the mechanism is somewhat clumsy and indices
over extension views are not well supported. The features of Gadfly
2.0 discussed here attempt to address these deficiencies by providing
a uniform extension model that permits addition of alternate table,
function, and predicate implementations.</P>

<P>Other deficiencies, such as missing constructs like &quot;ALTER
TABLE&quot; and the lack of outer joins and NULL values are not
addressed here, although they may be addressed in Gadfly 2.0 or
a later release. This paper also does not intend to explain
the complete operations of the internals; it is intended to provide
at least enough information to understand the basic mechanisms
for extending gadfly.</P>




<P>Some concepts and definitions provided next help with the description
of the gadfly interfaces. [Note: due to the terseness of this
format the ensuing is not a highly formal presentation, but attempts
to approach precision where precision is important.]</P>

<H4>The semilattice of substitutions</H4>

<P>Underlying the gadfly implementation are the basic concepts
associated with <I>substitutions</I>. A substitution is a <I>mapping</I>
of attribute names to values (implemented in gadfly using kjbuckets.kjDict
objects). Here an <em>attribute</em> refers to some sort of "descriptive
variable", such as NAME and a value is an assignment for that variable,
like "Dave Ascher".  In Gadfly a table is implemented as a sequence
of substitutions, and substitutions are used in many other ways as well.
<p>
For example consider the substitutions</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>A = [DRINKER=&gt;'sam']
B = [DRINKER=&gt;'sam', BAR=&gt;'cheers']
C = [DRINKER=&gt;'woody', BEER=&gt;'bud']
D = [DRINKER=&gt;'sam', BEER=&gt;'mickies']
E = [DRINKER=&gt;'sam', BAR=&gt;'cheers', BEER=&gt;'mickies']
F = [DRINKER=&gt;'sam', BEER=&gt;'mickies']
G = [BEER=&gt;'bud', BAR=&gt;'lolas']
H = [] # the empty substitution
I = [BAR=&gt;'cheers', CAPACITY=&gt;300]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A trivial but important observation is that since substitutions
are mappings, no attribute can assume more than one value in a
substitution. In the operations described below whenever an operator
&quot;tries&quot; to assign more than one value to an attribute
the operator yields an &quot;overdefined&quot; or &quot;inconsistent&quot;
result.</P>

<P><B>Information Semi-order:</B> Substitution B is said to be
<I>more informative</I> than A because B agrees with all assignments
in A (in addition to providing more information as well). Similarly
we say that E is more informative than A, B, D, F. and H but E
is not more informative than the others since, for example G disagrees
with E on the value assigned to the BEER attribute and I provides
additional CAPACITY information not provided in E.</P>

<P><B>Joins and Inconsistency:</B> A join of two substitutions
X and Y is the least informative substitution Z such that Z is
more informative (or equally informative) than both X and Y. For
example B is the join of B with A, E is the join of B with D and</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>E join I = 
 [DRINKER=&gt;'sam', BAR=&gt;'cheers', BEER=&gt;'mickies', CAPACITY=&gt;300]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For any two substitutions either (1) they disagree on the value
assigned to some attribute and have no join or (2) they agree
on all common attributes (if there are any) and their join is
the union of all (name, value) assignments in both substitutions.
Written in terms of kjbucket.kjDict operations two kjDicts X and
Y have a join Z = (X+Y) if and only if Z.Clean() is not None.
Two substitutions that have no join are said to be <I>inconsistent.
</I>For example I and G are inconsistent since they disagree on
the value assigned to the BAR attribute and therefore have no
join. The algebra of substitutions with joins technically defines
an abstract algebraic structure called a semilattice.</P>

<H4>Name space remapping</H4>

<P>Another primitive operation over substitutions is the remap
operation S2 = S.remap(R) where S is a substitution and R is a
graph of attribute names and S2 is a substitution. This operation
is defined to produce the substitution S2 such that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Name=&gt;Value in S2 if and only if 
    Name1=&gt;Value in S and Name&lt;=Name1 in R</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>or if there is no such substitution S2 the remap value is said
to be <I>overdefined.</I></P>

<P>For example the remap operation may be used to eliminate attributes
from a substitution. For example</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>E.remap([DRINKER&lt;=DRINKER, BAR&lt;=BAR])
  = [DRINKER=&gt;'sam', BAR=&gt;'cheers']</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Illustrating that remapping using the [DRINKER&lt;=DRINKER,
BAR&lt;=BAR] graph eliminates all attributes except DRINKER and
BAR, such as BEER. More generally remap can be used in this way
to implement the classical relational projection operation. (See [Korth and Silberschatz]
for a detailed discussion of the projection operator and other relational
algebra operators such as selection, rename, difference and joins.)</P>

<P>The remap operation can also be used to implement &quot;selection
on attribute equality&quot;. For example if we are interested
in the employee names of employees who are their own bosses we
can use the remapping graph</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>R1 = [NAME&lt;=NAME, NAME&lt;=BOSS]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and reject substitutions where remapping using R1 is overdefined.
For example</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>S1 = [NAME=&gt;'joe', BOSS=&gt;'joe']
S1.remap(R1) = [NAME=&gt;'joe']
S2 = [NAME=&gt;'fred', BOSS=&gt;'joe']
S2.remap(R1) is overdefined.</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The last remap is overdefined because the NAME attribute cannot
assume both the values 'fred' and 'joe' in a substitution.</P>

<P>Furthermore, of course, the remap operation can be used to
&quot;rename attributes&quot; or &quot;copy attribute values&quot;
in substitutions. Note below that the missing attribute CAPACITY
in B is effectively ignored in the remapping operation.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>B.remap([D&lt;=DRINKER, B&lt;=BAR, B2&lt;=BAR, C&lt;=CAPACITY])
   = [D=&gt;'sam', B=&gt;'cheers', B2=&gt;'cheers']</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>More interestingly, a single remap operation can be used to
perform a combination of renaming, projection, value copying,
and attribute equality selection as one operation. In kjbuckets the remapper
graph is implemented using a kjbuckets.kjGraph and the remap operation
is an intrinsic method of kjbuckets.kjDict objects.</P>

<H4>Generalized Table Joins and the Evaluator Mainloop</H4>

<P>Strictly speaking the Gadfly 2.0 query evaluator only uses
the join and remap operations as its &quot;basic assembly language&quot;
-- all other computations, including inequality comparisons and
arithmetic, are implemented externally to the evaluator as &quot;generalized
table joins.&quot;</P>

<P>A table is a sequence of substitutions (which in keeping with
SQL semantics may contain redundant entries). The join between
two tables T1 and T2 is the sequence of all possible defined joins
between pairs of elements from the two tables. Procedurally we
might compute the join as</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>T1JoinT2 = empty
for t1 in T1:
    for t2 in T2:
        if t1 join t2 is defined:
            add t1 join t2 to T1joinT2</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In general circumstances this intuitive implementation is a
very inefficient way to compute the join, and Gadfly almost always
uses other methods, particularly since, as described below, a
&quot;generalized table&quot; can have an &quot;infinite&quot;
number of entries.</P>

<P>For an example of a table join consider the EMPLOYEES table
containing</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[NAME=&gt;'john', JOB=&gt;'executive']
[NAME=&gt;'sue', JOB=&gt;'programmer']
[NAME=&gt;'eric', JOB=&gt;'peon']
[NAME=&gt;'bill', JOB=&gt;'peon']</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and the ACTIVITIES table containing</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[JOB=&gt;'peon', DOES=&gt;'windows']
[JOB=&gt;'peon', DOES=&gt;'floors']
[JOB=&gt;'programmer', DOES=&gt;'coding']
[JOB=&gt;'secretary', DOES=&gt;'phone']</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>then the join between EMPLOYEES and ACTIVITIES must containining</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[NAME=&gt;'sue', JOB=&gt;'programmer', DOES=&gt;'coding']
[NAME=&gt;'eric', JOB=&gt;'peon', DOES=&gt;'windows']
[NAME=&gt;'bill', JOB=&gt;'peon', DOES=&gt;'windows']
[NAME=&gt;'eric', JOB=&gt;'peon', DOES=&gt;'floors']
[NAME=&gt;'bill', JOB=&gt;'peon', DOES=&gt;'floors']</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A compiled gadfly subquery ultimately appears to the evaluator
as a sequence of generalized tables that must be joined (in combination
with certain remapping operations that are beyond the scope of
this discussion). The Gadfly mainloop proceeds following the very
loose pseudocode:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Subs = [ [] ] # the unary sequence containing &quot;true&quot;
While some table hasn't been chosen yet:
    Choose an unchosen table with the least cost join estimate.
    Subs = Subs joined with the chosen table
return Subs</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>[Note that it is a property of the join operation that the
order in which the joins are carried out will not affect the result,
so the greedy strategy of evaluating the &quot;cheapest join next&quot;
will not effect the result. Also note that the treatment of logical
OR and NOT as well as EXIST, IN, UNION, and aggregation and so
forth are not discussed here, even though they do fit into this
approach.]</P>

<P>The actual implementation is a bit more complex than this,
but the above outline may provide some useful intuition. The &quot;cost
estimation&quot; step and the implementation of the join operation
itself are left up to the generalized table object implementation.
A table implementation has the ability to give an &quot;infinite&quot;
cost estimate, which essentially means &quot;don't join me in
yet under any circumstances.&quot;</P>

<H4>Implementing Functions</H4>

<P>As mentioned above operations such as arithmetic are implemented
using generalized tables. For example the arithmetic Add operation
is implemented in Gadfly internally as an &quot;infinite generalized
table&quot; containing all possible substitutions</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[ARG0=&gt;a, ARG1=&gt;b, RESULT=&gt;a+b]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Where a and b are all possible values which can be summed.
Clearly, it is not possible to enumerate this table, but given
a sequence of substitutions with defined values for ARG0 and ARG1
such as</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[ARG0=&gt;1, ARG1=-4]
[ARG0=&gt;2.6, ARG1=50]
[ARG0=&gt;99, ARG1=1]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>it is possible to implement a &quot;join operation&quot; against
this sequence that performs the same augmentation as a join with
the infinite table defined above:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[ARG0=&gt;1, ARG1=-4, RESULT=-3]
[ARG0=&gt;2.6, ARG1=50, RESULT=52.6]
[ARG0=&gt;99, ARG1=1, RESULT=100]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Furthermore by giving an &quot;infinite estimate&quot; for
all attempts to evaluate the join where ARG0 and ARG1 are not
available the generalized table implementation for the addition
operation can refuse to compute an &quot;infinite join.&quot;</P>

<P>More generally all functions f(a,b,c,d) are represented in
gadfly as generalized tables containing all possible relevant
entries</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[ARG0=&gt;a, ARG1=&gt;b, ARG2=&gt;c, ARG3=&gt;d, RESULT=&gt;f(a,b,c,d)]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and the join estimation function refuses all attempts to perform
a join unless all the arguments are provided by the input substitution
sequence.</P>

<H4>Implementing Predicates</H4>

<P>Similarly to functions, predicates such as less-than and BETWEEN
and LIKE are implemented using the generalized table mechanism.
For example the &quot;x BETWEEN y AND z&quot; predicate is implemented
as a generalized table &quot;containing&quot; all possible</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[ARG0=&gt;a, ARG1=&gt;b, ARG2=&gt;c]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where b&lt;a&lt;c. Furthermore joins with this table are not
permitted unless all three arguments are available in the sequence
of input substitutions.</P>

<H4>Some Gadfly extension interfaces</H4>

<P>A gadfly database engine may be extended with user defined
functions, predicates, and alternative table and index implementations.
This section snapshots several Gadfly 2.0 interfaces, currently under
development and likely to change before the package is released.

<P>The basic interface for adding functions and predicates (logical tests)
to a gadfly engine are relatively straightforward.  For example to add the
ability to match a regular expression within a gadfly query use the
following implementation.
<pre>
   from re import match

   def addrematch(gadflyinstance):
       gadflyinstance.add_predicate("rematch", match)
</pre>
Then upon connecting to the database execute
<pre>
   g = gadfly(...)
   ...
   addrematch(g)
</pre>
In this case the "semijoin operation" associated with the new predicate
"rematch" is automatically generated, and after the add_predicate
binding operation the gadfly instance supports queries such as
<pre>
   select drinker, beer
   from likes
   where rematch('b*', beer) and drinker not in
     (select drinker from frequents where rematch('c*', bar))
</pre>
By embedding the "rematch" operation within the query the SQL
engine can do "more work" for the programmer and reduce or eliminate the
need to process the query result externally to the engine.
<p>
In a similar manner functions may be added to a gadfly instance,
<pre>
   def modulo(x,y):
       return x % y

   def addmodulo(gadflyinstance):
       gadflyinstance.add_function("modulo", modulo)

   ...
   g = gadfly(...)
   ...
   addmodulo(g)
</pre>
Then after the binding the modulo function can be used whereever
an SQL expression can occur.
<p>
Adding alternative table implementations to a Gadfly instance
is more interesting and more difficult.  An "extension table" implementation
must conform to the following interface:
<pre>
    # get the kjbuckets.kjSet set of attribute names for this table
    names = table.attributes()

    # estimate the difficulty of evaluating a join given known attributes
    #  return None for "impossible" or n>=0 otherwise with larger values
    #    indicating greater difficulty or expense
    estimate = table.estimate(known_attributes)

    # return the join of the rows of the table with
    # the list of kjbuckets.kjDict mappings as a list of mappings.
    resultmappings = table.join(listofmappings)
</pre>
In this case add the table to a gadfly instance using
<pre>
    gadflyinstance.add_table("table_name", table)
</pre>
For example to add a table which automatically queries filenames
in the filesystems of the host computer a gadfly instance could
be augmented with a GLOB table implemented using the standard
library function glob.glob as follows:
<pre>
   import kjbuckets

   class GlobTable:
       def __init__(self): pass

       def attributes(self):
           return kjbuckets.kjSet("PATTERN", "NAME") 

       def estimate(self, known_attributes):
           if known_attributes.member("PATTERN"):
               return 66 # join not too difficult
           else:
               return None # join is impossible (must have PATTERN)

       def join(self, listofmappings):
           from glob import glob
           result = []
           for m in listofmappings:
               pattern = m["PATTERN"]
               for name in glob(pattern):
                   newmapping = kjbuckets.kjDict(m)
                   newmapping["NAME"] = name
                   if newmapping.Clean():
                       result.append(newmapping)
           return result

   ...
   gadfly_instance.add_table("GLOB", GlobTable())
</pre>
Then one could formulate queries such as "list the files in directories
associated with packages installed by guido"
<pre>
   select g.name as filename
   from packages p, glob g
   where p.installer = 'guido' and g.pattern=p.root_directory
</pre>
Note that conceptually the GLOB table is an infinite table including
all filenames on the current computer in the "NAME" column, paired with
a potentially infinite number of patterns.
<p>
More interesting examples would allow queries to remotely access
data served by an HTTP server, or from any other resource.
<p>
Furthermore an extension table can be augmented with update methods
<pre>
      table.insert_rows(listofmappings)
      table.update_rows(oldlist, newlist)
      table.delete_rows(oldlist)
</pre>
Note: at present the implementation does not enforce recovery or
transaction semantics for updates to extension tables, although this
may change in the final release.
<p>
The table implementation is free to provide its own implementations of
indices which take advantage of data provided by the join argument.

<H4>Efficiency Notes</H4>

<P>The following thought experiment attempts to explain why the
Gadfly implementation is surprisingly fast considering that it
is almost entirely implemented in Python (an interpreted programming
language which is not especially fast when compared to alternatives).
Although Gadfly is quite complex, at an abstract level the process
of query evaluation boils down to a series of embedded loops.
Consider the following nested loops:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>iterate 1000:
   f(...) # fixed cost of outer loop
   iterate 10:
      g(...) # fixed cost of middle loop
      iterate 10:
         # the real work (string parse, matrix mul, query eval...)
         h(...)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In my experience many computations follow this pattern where
f, g, are complex, dynamic, special purpose and h is simple, general
purpose, static. Some example computations that follow this pattern
include: file massaging (perl), matrix manipulation (python, tcl),
database/cgi page generation, and vector graphics/imaging.</P>

<P>Suppose implementing f, g, h in python is easy but result in
execution times10 times slower than a much harder implementation
in C, choosing arbitrary and debatable numbers assume each function
call consumes 1 tick in C, 5 ticks in java, 10 ticks in python
for a straightforward implementation of each function f, g, and
h. Under these conditions we get the following cost analysis,
eliminating some uninteresting combinations, of implementing the
function f, g, and h in combinations of Python, C and java:</P>

  <PRE>COST    | FLANG  | GLANG  | HLANG 
==================================
111000  | C      | C      | C     
115000  | java   | C      | C     
120000  | python | C      | C     
155000  | java   | java   | C     
210000  | python | python | C     
555000  | java   | java   | java 
560000  | python | java   | java

1110000 | python | python | python</PRE>

<P>Note that moving <I>only the innermost loop to C</I> (python/python/C)
speeds up the calculation by <I>half an order of magnitude </I>compared
to the python-only implementation and brings the speed to within
a factor of 2 of an implementation done entirely in C.</P>

<P>Although this artificial and contrived thought experiment is
far from conclusive, we may be tempted to draw the conclusion
that generally programmers should focus first on obtaining a working
implementation (because as John Ousterhout is reported to have
said &quot;the biggest performance improvement is the transition
from non-working to working&quot;) using the methodology that
is most likely to obtain a working solution the quickest (Python
<FONT FACE="Courier New">;c)</FONT> ). <I>Only then if the performance
is inadequate </I>should the programmer<I> </I>focus on optimizing
the inner most loops, perhaps moving them to a very efficient
implementation (C). Optimizing the outer loops will buy little
improvement, and should be done later, if ever.</P>

<P>This was precisely the strategy behind the gadfly implementations,
where most of the inner loops are implemented in the kjbuckets
C extension module and the higher level logic is all in Python.
This also explains why gadfly appears to be &quot;slower&quot;
for simple queries over small data sets, but seems to be relatively
&quot;faster&quot; for more complex queries over larger data sets,
since larger queries and data sets take better advantage of the
optimized inner loops.</P>

<H4>A Gadfly variant for OLAP?</H4>

<P>In private correspondence Andy Robinson points out that the
basic logical design underlying Gadfly could be adapted to provide
Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and other forms of data warehousing
and data mining. Since SQL is not particularly well suited for
the kinds of requests common in these domains the higher level
interfaces would require modification, but the underlying logic
of substitutions and name mappings seems to be appropriate.</P>

<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<P>The revamped query engine design in Gadfly 2 supports
a flexible and general extension methodology that permits programmers
to extend the gadfly engine to include additional computations
and access to remote data sources. Among other possibilities this
will permit the gadfly engine to make use of disk based indexed
tables and to dynamically retrieve information from remote data
sources (such as an Excel spreadsheet or an Oracle database).
These features will make gadfly a very useful tool for data manipulation
and integration.</P>
