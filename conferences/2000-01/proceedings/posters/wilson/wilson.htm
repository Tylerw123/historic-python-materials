</B><I><P>Build</I> is a software framework designed for the development of multimedia applications, which uses Python as a scripting language. </P>

<I><P>Build</I> currently exists as an executable running under Microsoft Windows from which the user can create and edit <I>Build</I> documents using a graphical editing environment.  These documents can be populated with a wide variety of user-interface objects, ranging from simple ones such as pictures and borders, through to the more complex such as scrolling text. Further user interface component types can be defined using Python.</P>

<P>Python is also used to define the functionality behind these interfaces. A wide variety of predefined behaviours is present within <I>Build</I> itself and these can be extended through user defined Python scripts. <I>Build</I> can also be used in conjunction with 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party Python libraries.</P>

<I><P>Build</I> can be put to a wide variety of uses. Multimedia presentations are easily assembled using the framework. It is also useful as a tool for the creation of desktop utility programs. More complex applications can be built with more extensive Python scripting.</P>

<P>The aim of the demonstration is to give a concise overview of the capabilities of <I>Build</I>, and to provide an introduction to the manner in which <I>Build</I> applications are created, with the focus primarily on graphical and user-interface components. We will also demonstrate a number of projects undertaken with <I>Build</I>, including a multimedia database using Gadfly, some multimedia presentations, and a variety of in-house production tools.</P>
