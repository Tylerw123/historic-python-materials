Sorry I am so damn disorganized.  Depending on time-zones, I may just
sneak in :-)

At this stage I can commit to attending the conference, presenting a
tutorial, and possibly an "invited talk".

The tutorial will be "Advanced Python and COM", and content will come
largely from the book, and have a different focus from the one Greg
and I did a few years ago (which was too esoteric in hind-sight) -
that is about all I know about it at this stage!

The invited talk will possibly be as I discussed previously - a topic
that is currently under non-disclosure agreement.  It is almost
certain that some disclosure restrictions will be lifted by then, but
it is unclear it is will all be lifted.  Im guessing that this talk
would not be very long - anything up to an hour would be fine.
Unfortunately I cant commit to too much here due to these bloody
lawyers [If it makes Guido feel any better, Im having to deal with MS
lawyers, and they seem to be making the CNRI lawyers look like a bunch
of girl-scouts :-[

Sorry for my disorganized state.  As I am not submitting a refereed
paper, I guess you dont need actual content yet.  Please let me know
when you need a copy of the tutorial itself.  As I become aware of the
NDA requirements being lifted I will let you know how the "invited
talk" plans go...

Thanks,

Mark.
