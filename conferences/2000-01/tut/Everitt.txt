I'll get this handled pronto.

Well this definately brings up a good litmus test.  The point of having
a Zope track is focus on Zope at the conference.  While the others on
the program committee mind find it much, that shouldn't matter, as it is
just part of the Zope track.  Since we are committing to bringing a
noticeable increase in the attendence in exchange for the track...
