Hello,

Attached below is my abstract and outline for a wxPython Tutorial at IPC-8.
I havn't included time estimates yet as I am not yet sure how much material
I will have for each section or how long it will take to present it.  I will
be presenting part of this to the PORPIG on Monday so I will have a better
idea then.  If I need to add more material for the IPC I can, or
alternativly I can present a small case-study of using wxPython in a useful
application.

wxPython Tutorial


Abstract
--------

wxPython is a GUI toolkit for Python that is implemented as a wrapper
around the wxWindows cross-platform C++ class library, (see
http://www.wxwindows.org/.)  This tutorial will give the attendees a
basic introduction to wxPython and will give them enough knowledge to
get themselves up and running with the toolkit.  Tutorial topics
covered include general architecture, an overview of the commonly used
classes, an understanding of the event system and how to use it,
window layout techniques, and an overview of some of the application
frameworks provided.  The presentation will conclude with a discussion
of resources available to the wxPython programmer, and a simple
comparison to other GUI toolkits. The tutorial will also include
several small sample applications that illustrate the concepts being
presented.
