<h2>Open Source and Venture Capital</h2>

<p>Keynote by <a href="http://www.opticality.com">Hadar Pedhazur</a>.

<p>Open Source and Venture Capital have found each
other. Witness the detailed article in the January 2000
issue of Linux Magazine. However, in this case, not only has
Venture Capital found a Python company, but to a large
degree, Python created a Venture Capitalist!

<p>This talk begins with the history of Hadar Pedhazur's
discovery and use of Python at the Union Bank of Switzerland
(UBS), which led to his discovery of Digital Creations. From
that, the leap to Venture Capitalist was natural and obvious
:-).
