</h3>
</center>

The 8th International Python Conference is a forum for Python users,
software developers, and researchers to present current work, discuss
future plans for the language, and to learn about interesting uses of
Python.  The conference includes a day of tutorials, two days of
papers, a work in progress session, demonstrations, a poster session,
and a Developers' Day.   

<p>

<b>Please note that the dates above have been finally confirmed.  We
also know that the conference will be held at the Hilton Alexandria
Old Town.</b>

<p>
<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<ul>
<li> Sep. 30 : Deadline for papers and tutorials.
<li> Oct. 22 : Notification of acceptance for papers
<li> Nov. 19 : Deadline for final versions of full papers
</ul>

<b>These dates were updated 10-Aug-1999</b> and reflect the current
schedule.

<h3>Papers</h3>

We invite authors to submit papers describing new and useful
applications and tools that utilize Python.  We have a special
interest in papers that address practical programming problems as well
as experience papers that provide lessons for Python programmers.  In
constrast to last year's conference, we are trying to focus the
conference more on applications and less on Python internals.  Thus,
we particularly encourage the submission of papers that describe the
use of Python in large, mission critical, or unusual applications.

<p>
Specific paper topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li> Large applications and systems written in Python or which
      use Python as a glue language.

<li> Internet applications, including Web content and administration,
      network programming, distributed objects, and Zope-related
      applications.

<li> Scientific, engineering, and numeric applications.

<li> Integration with other languages and systems, including Java, 
      CORBA, COM, embedded systems, etc.

<li> Python on Windows, including Active Scripting, NT system
      administration.  

<li> Extension modules and new developments for the core language.

<li> Programming patterns and OO design strategies.

<li> Practical programming advice and tools to aid in program
      construction and debugging.

<li> GUI programming.

<li> Database and ODBC applications.

<li> Use of Python in education.
</ul>


<p>
Papers that describe applications should balance the need to appeal to
Python programmers at-large against the need for application-specific
details.  Authors should focus on presenting issues and techniques
that have wider relevance to the audience, but should also provide
enough explanatory material to make application-specific issues
understandable to a wider audience.

<p>
Papers will be judged on the quality and quantity of technical
content, the presentation and writing, and their relevance to the
Python community.

<h3>What to Submit and How to Submit It</h3>

Paper submissions should be approximately 6 to 12 single-space,
8.5"x11" pages (about 3000-6000 words) including an abstract.  Papers
must be original works not previously published or submitted for
publication elsewhere.  The conference proceedings will be made
available online and in printed form.  Authors will need to provide
Postscript and HTML versions of their final papers.

<p>
Submissions can be made in any of the following formats: HTML (single
page with no external links), Postscript, or PDF.  Regardless of
format, be sure that it can be viewed and printed on a wide variety of
systems (avoid unusual fonts and browser-specific tags).

<p>
Specific submission instructions will be made available on
<a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org.</a>
