<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p><em>The Python Object Publisher (Bobo) allows objects to be
published without any Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specific code. Complex object hierarchies can
be published with Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that mimic the
object hierachies. Form data, including file upload data, are
marshalled into method parameters. Most tasks associated with the
interaction between an application (such as URL traversal, parsing
form data, parsing queries, parsing headers, parsing cookie data,
access control, and error handling) are performed automatically. This
paper provides an overview and simple examples.</em></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Publishing dynamic information on the web is straightforward.
Publishing it <em>coherently</em> is unnecessarily difficult.</p>

<p>Generally, connecting code to the Web involves the use of the
Common Gateway Interface[<a href="#CGI">1</a>] (CGI). For Python[<a
href="#PythonHomePage">2</a>], this involves using the
<code>cgi.py</code> module. The purpose of this module is to assist in
bringing HTML form data into your Python application.</p>

<p>For many uses, this is a wonderful boost. However, the scope of the
module doesn't assist in returning the necessary HTTP headers.  Nor
does it provide support for things such as parsing cookies, or
handling exceptions.</p>

<p>Moreover, your code is wired to use CGI.  What if you would like to
use FastCGI[<a href="#FastCGI">3</a>], or ILU[<a href="#ILU">4</a>],
or COM/DCOM[<a href="#COM">5</a>] as a server-extension mechanism?
Or, if you would like to use a native Python-HTTP service? Or, when
you would like to use your application <em>without</em> the Web
(e.g. from the command line for debugging, or in a GUI framework?</p>

<p>This gives some background on the Python Object Publisher[<a
name="#Bobo">6</a>], affectionately known as Bobo. The original
premise was to provide a level of abstraction between our ways to
publish objects. To date, we have used:

<ul>
  <li> CGI, 
  <li> ILU,
  <li>  FastCGI,
  <li>  PersistentCGI[<a href="pCGI">7</a>],
  <li>  a Python-HTTP server
</ul>

and are looking at COM/DCOM as well as CORBA[<a
href="#CORBA">7</a>]. The layer of abstraction would immunize that
actual application from the infrastructure. Or, as the docstring says:

<pre>The Python object publisher provides a simple mechanism for
publishing a collection of Python objects as World Wide Web (Web)
resources without any plumbing (e.g. CGI) specific code.</pre>

<p>Next, we wanted the ability to prevent application errors from
returning strange traceback messages. As well, we wanted to find a way
to map a URL into a full message sent to invoke an operation on an
object.  For instance, having:<br><br>

<a name="SampleURL"><code>http://www.here.com/cgi-bin/example/Cars/Pinto/purchase?name=Bob</code></a>
<br><br>

maps into an object traversal of <code>Cars</code> to invoke the
<code>purchase</code> method on the instance <code>Pinto</code>,
sending in an argument of <code>name</code> with a value of
<code>Bob</code>.</p>

<p>Subsequently, we began adding many more new features, and
integrating other work to turn Bobo into an excellent environment for
publishing Python objects. The next section discusses the
benefits.</p>


<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>The following is an overview of some reasons to use Bobo:
<ul>

<li>Applications do not have to include code for interfacing with the
    web server.

<li>Applications can be moved from one publishing mechanism, such as
    CGI, to another mechanism, such as Fast CGI or ILU Requestor, with
    no change.

<li>Python objects are published as Python objects.  The web server
    "calls" the objects in much the same way that other Python objects
    would.

<li>Automatic conversion of URL to object/subobject traversal.

<li>Automatic marshaling of form data, cookie data, and request
    meta-data to Python function arguments.

<li>Automated exception handling.

<li>Automatic generation of CGI headers.

<li>Automated authentication and authorization using a rich mechanism.

<li>With a name like Bobo, it's gotta be good.

</ul>


<h2>Typical Bobo Setup</h2>

<p>To setup a module to be published by Bobo, you first decide what
mechanism you'd like to use. Presuming you'd like to use CGI, you
first setup your CGI directory, and a different directory that
contains your application and its modules. This distinction enables
you to protect your code by placing it outside of your Web root. Also,
it allows many CGI areas to share the same code base.</p>

<p>Next, you join the two by making a symbolic link. The source would
be a generic module that implemented the Bobo plumbing for CGI, which
is named <code>cgi-module-publisher</code>. This generic module would
be in the same directory as your application. The target of the
symbolic link would be the application's name <em>in the CGI
directory</em>.</p>

<p>For instance, in the URL mentioned <a href="#SampleURL">above</a>,
you might have the application installed in
<code>/apps/mambo</code>. The main module is
<code>example.py</code>, located in that directory. However, your Web
root is in <code>/httpd/docs</code>, with a CGI directory of
<code>/httpd/docs/cgi-bin</code>. You would publish
example.py with the command:<br><br>

<font size="-1"><code>ln -s /apps/mambo/cgi-module-publisher
/httpd/docs/cgi-bin/example</code></font></p>

<p>What happens? The CGI call executes <code>example</code>, which is
a symbolic link to the CGI module publisher. This standard Bobo module
then looks for a module in its directory that has the same name as the
CGI script (basically, the Python variable
<code>sys.argv[1]</code>). Bobo then imports that module, and starts
looking for objects that match the request. We call this publishing
your object "under Bobo control", as Bobo is encapsulating your
objects.</p>

<p>A final note is that the ".", or current working directory, is
still over in the CGI directory, even though your module can import
things from the application directory.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Of course, everyone would like to start out with a code
snippet. Here is an overview of a sample Bobo application. Let's say
we have the following module:

<pre><font size="-1"><xmp>
#!/usr/local/bin/python 
'''An example module for the Bobo paper.

This gives a simple example of nested objects, and publishing objects
which receive messages from the Web. The URL might be:

   http://yourplace.mars/cgi-bin/example/Cars/Pinto/purchaseForm'''

class Car:
    '''Vehicle, four wheels, you know what I mean.'''

    def purchaseForm(self,PARENT_URL):
	'''Give a short form back to collect purchase info.'''

	form = (
	    '<h1>Purchase Information</h1>\n'
	    '<p>Please enter the information below:\n'
	    '<form action="%s/purchase" method="GET">\n'
	    'Name: <input name="name"> Age: <input name="age:int">\n'
	    '<input type="submit" </form></p>')

	# PARENT_URL is supplied by Bobo, and tracks location in PATH_INFO
	response = form % PARENT_URL

	# Set TITLE, and return body
	return ('Purchase Information Form',response)

    def purchase(self,name,age):
	'''Send back some calculation.'''

	form = ('<h1>Thank You For Your Purchase</h1>'
		'<p>Well, %s, I think you are %s in dog years.</p>')

	# Bobo converted age to an integer, as directed in the form
	dog_years = age / 7
	response = form % (name,dog_years)
	return ('Purchase made',response)

pinto = Car()
taurus = Car()
lecar = Car()

# Make a dictionary, but give it a fake docstring to make it public
Cars__doc__ = "Clever hack, n'est-ce pas?"
Cars = {'Pinto':pinto, 'Taurus':taurus, 'LeCar':lecar}
</xmp></font></pre>
</p>

<p>The following URLs will give back the listed results:
<ol>

  <li> <code>cgi-bin/example/help</code>: Returns the docstring for the module.

  <li> <code>cgi-bin/example/Cars/help</code>: Returns the docstring for
the Cars dictionary.

  <li> <code>cgi-bin/example/Cars/Pinto/help</code>: Returns the docstring
for the Pinto instance.

  <li> <code>cgi-bin/example/Cars/Pinto/purchaseForm</code>: Give the form
to interact with a Car instance.

</ol>
</p>

<p>For example, here is what the Web server returns for the last URL:

<pre><font size="-1"><xmp>
GET /cgi-bin/example/Cars/Pinto/purchaseForm HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Tuesday, 08-Oct-96 15:37:19 GMT
Server: Open-Market-Secure-WebServer/2.0.0.RC3
MIME-version: 1.0
Security-Scheme: S-HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 450
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
<head>
<title>Purchase Information Form</title>
	<base href="http://here.com/cgi-bin/">
</head>
<body>
<h1>Purchase Information</h1>
<p>Please enter the information below:
<form action="http://here.com/cgi-bin/example/Cars/Pinto/purchase" method="GET">
Name: <input name="name"> Age: <input name="age:int">
<input type="submit" </form></p>
</body>
</html>
</xmp></font></pre>
</p>

<p>This example shows several interesting Bobo features:

<ul>

  <li> Bobo handles a great deal of the HTTP (and some of the HTML) 
for you,

  <li> Modules and objects can have builtin help methods, which return
docstrings over the Web,

  <li> The Cars dictionary was mapped to a hierarchical URL, 

  <li> The Cars dictionary had simulated metadata (a docstring)
assigned to it,

  <li> Instance methods are invoked with arguments passed in and
converted to the right type,

  <li> The whole thing looks like a normal Python application and has
little Web-dependent constructs.

</ul>
</p>


<h2>Publishing Objects</h2>
<p>  Objects are published by including them in a published module.
  When a module is published, any objects that:

<ul>

  <li>can be found in the module's global name space,

  <li>that do not have names starting with an underscore,

  <li>that have non-empty documentation strings, and

  <li>that are not modules

</ul>

are published.</p>

<p>  Alternatively, a module variable named <code>web_objects</code> can be
  defined.  If this variable is defined, it should be bound to a
  mapping object that maps published names to published objects.
  Objects that are published through a module's <code>web_objects</code> are not
  subject to the restrictions listed above. For example, modules or
  objects without documentation strings may be published by including
  them in a module's <code>web_objects</code> attribute.</p>

<p>  Subobjects (or sub-sub objects, ...) of published objects are
  also published, as long as the subobjects:</p>
<ul>

  <li>have non-empty doc strings,

  <li>have names that do not begin with an underscore, and

  <li>are not modules.

</ul>
</p>

<p>  A subobject that cannot have a docstring may be published by
  including a special attribute in the containing object named:
  subobject_name__doc__.  For example, if foo.bar.spam doesn't have a
  doc string, but foo.bar has a non-empty attribute
  foo.bar.spam__doc__, then foo.bar.spam can be published.</p>

<p>  Note that object methods are considered to be subobjects.</p>

<p>  Object-to-subobject traversal is done by converting steps in the URI
  path to get attribute or get item calls.  For example, in traversing
  from <code>http://some.host/some_module/object</code> to
  <code>http://some.host/some_module/object/subobject</code>, the module
  publisher will try to get <code>some_module.object.subobject</code>.  If the
  access fails with other than an attribute error, then the object
  publisher raises a "NotFound" exception.  If the access fails with
  an attribute error, then the object publisher will try to obtain the
  subobject with: <code>some_module.object["subobject"]</code>.  If this access
  fails, then the object publisher raises a <code>"Not Found"</code> exception.  If
  either of the accesses suceeds, then, of course, processing continues.</p>

<p>  If the final object encountered when traversing the URL has an
  <code>index_html</code> attribute, the object traversal will continue to this
  attribute.   This is useful for providing default methods for objects.</p>

<p>  In some cases, a parent object may hold special attributes for a
  subobject.  This may be the case either when a subobject cannot have
  the special attribute or when it is convenience for the parent
  object to manage attribute data (e.g. to share attribute data among
  multiple children).  When the object publisher looks for a special
  attribute, it first trys to get the attribute from the published
  object.  If it fails to get the special attribute, it uses the same
  access mechanism used to extract the subobject from the parent
  object to get an attribute (or item) using a name obtained by
  concatenating the subobject name with the special attribute
  name. For example, let <code>foo.bar</code> be a dictionary, and foo.bar.spam
  an item in the dictionary.  When attempting to obtain the special
  attribute <code>__realm__</code>, the object publisher will first try to
  evaluate <code>foo.bar.spam.__realm__</code>, and then try to evaluate:
  <code>foo.bar["spam"+"__realm__"]</code>. </p>


<h2>Controlling Returned HTML</h2>

<p> A published object, or the returned value of a called published
  object can be of any Python type.  If the returned value has an
  <code>asHTML</code> method, then this method will be called to convert the
  object to HTML; otherwise, the returned value will be converted to a
  string and examined to see if it appears to be an HTML document.  If
  it appears to be an HTML document, then the response content-type
  will be set to <code>text/html</code>.  Otherwise, the content-type will be set
  to <code>text/plain</code>.</p>

<p>  A special case is when the returned object is a two-element tuple.
  If the return object is a two-element tuple, then the first element
  will be converted to a string and treated as an HTML title, and
  the second element will be converted to a string and treated as
  the contents of an HTML body. An HTML document is created and
  returned (with type text/html) by adding necessary html, head,
  title, and body tags.</p>

<p>  If the returned object is None or the string representation of the
  returned object is an empty string, then the HTTP return status will
  be set "No Content", and no body will be returned.  On some
  browsers, this will cause the displayed document to be unchanged.</p>

<p>For instance, if an invoked method ends with the statement:

<pre><xmp>
return ('Your car has been purchased',
        '<h2>Thank you!</h2><p>Your money will look great in our account.</p>'
       )
</xmp></pre>

then an HTML document will be returned. A <code>TITLE</code> of
"Your car has been purchased" will be inserted into a skeletal HTML
snippet. </p>

<p>Bobo will also assist in setting the BASE tag to alleviate the
affects of nested object references in PATH_INFO.</p>


<h2>Exception Handling</h2> <p> Unhandled exceptions are caught by the
object publisher and are translated automatically to nicely formatted
HTTP output.</p>

<p> When an exception is raised, the exception type is mapped to an
HTTP code by matching the value of the exception type with a list of
standard HTTP status names.  Any exception types that do not match
standard HTTP status names are mapped to "Internal Error" (500). The
standard HTTP status names are: <code>"OK"</code>,
<code>"Created"</code>, <code>"Accepted"</code>, <code>"No
Content"</code>, <code>"Multiple Choices"</code>,
<code>"Redirect"</code>, <code>"Moved Permanently"</code>,
<code>"Moved Temporarily"</code>, <code>"Not Modified"</code>,
<code>"Bad Request"</code>, <code>"Unauthorized"</code>,
<code>"Forbidden"</code>, <code>"Not Found"</code>, <code>"Internal
Error"</code>, <code>"Not Implemented"</code>, <code>"Bad
Gateway"</code>, and <code>"Service Unavailable"</code>, Variations on
these names with different cases and without spaces are also
valid.</p>

<p> An attempt is made to use the exception value as the body of the
returned response.  The object publisher will examine the exception
value.  If the value is a string that contains some white space, then
it will be used as the body of the return error message.  It appears
to be HTML, the error content type will be set to
<code>text/html</code>, otherwise, it will be set to
<code>text/plain</code>.  If the exception value is not a string
containing white space, then the object publisher will generate it's
own error message.</p>

<p>The exceptions to the above are not covered here.</p>

<h2>Handling Request Data</h2>

<p>One of the essential benefits of Bobo is that you get to write
Python code that looks like Python code. That is, if you have a method
that expects some arguments, Bobo will get those values out of the
request and pass them into your object.</p>

<p>How does Bobo do it? First, it traverses the PATH_INFO to get to
the final object.  Let's say the final object is a method of an
instance. This method in your module is expecting 'name' and 'age' to
be passed in, as stated in the method signature <code>(self, name,
age)</code>. Bobo inspects the incoming form data, finds the values
for the 'name' and 'age' fields, and passes them in as arguments as it
calls your method "under Bobo control".</p>

<p>If you put an argument in your method signature, it must be in the
request.  Otherwise, Bobo will return a HTTP error with a
nicely-formatted error message. You can get around this by providing
default arguments for those variables that are not mandatory. For
instance, you could have a method signature of <code>(self, name,
age=None)</code>.</p>

<p>    Normally, string arguments are passed to called objects. The
    called object must be prepared to convert string arguments to
    other data types, such as numbers.</p>

<p>    If file upload fields are used; however, then FileUpload objects
    will be passed instead for these fields.  FileUpload objects
    bahave like file objects and provide attributes for inspecting the
    uploaded file's source name and the upload headers, such as
    content-type. </p>

<p>    If field names in form data are of the form: name:type, then an
    attempt will be to convert data from from strings to the indicated
    type.  The data types currently supported are: </p>
<dl><dt>        float<dd><p>Python floating point numbers</p>


<dt>        int<dd><p>Python integers</p>


<dt>        long<dd><p>Python long integers</p>


<dt>        string<dd><p>python strings</p>


<dt>        regex<dd><p>Python case-sensitive regular expressions</p>


<dt>        Regex<dd><p>Python case-insensitive regular expressions</p>


<dt>        date<dd><p>Date-time values</p>

</dl>

<p>    For example, if the name of a field in an input
    form is age:int, then the field value will be passed in argument,
    age, and an attempt will be made to convert the argument value to
    an integer.  This conversion also works with file upload, so using
    a file upload field with a name like myfile:string will cause the
    UploadFile to be converted to a string before being passed to the
    object.  </p>

<p>Additionally, Bobo will bind special values to variables and make
them available in method signatures. The most common are those
supported in the standard <code>cgi.py</code> module. However, other
interesting arguments might be the <code>REQUEST</code> and
<code>RESPONSE</code> objects can be obtained. These allow finer
control of Bobo's handling of the operation.</p>

<p>The most interesting additions to the extended variables are those
that provide new services. For instance, supporting cookies is a
breeze. If you expect a value from a cookie, just put the name of the
cookie in the method signature. Bobo will get it for you. Also, there
are variables that can help in object traversal, such as BASE,
PARENT_URL (the URL to the spot above you in the hierarchy), and
others.</p>


<h2>Access Control</h2>

<p>  Access to an object (and it's subobjects) may be further restricted
  by specifying an object attribute named <code>__allow_groups__</code>.  If set,
  this attribute should contain a collection of authorization groups.
  The <code>__allow_groups__</code> attribute may be a mapping object, in which
  case it is a collection of named groups.  Alternatively, the
  <code>__allow_groups__</code> attribute may be a sequence, in which case it is
  a collection of named groups.  Each group must be a dictionary that
  use names as keys (i.e. sets of names).  The values in these
  dictionaries may contain passwords for authenticating each of the
  names.  Alternatively, passwords may be provided in separate "realm"
  objects.  If no realm is provided, then basic authentication will be
  used and the object publisher will attempt to authenticate the
  access to the object using one of the supplied name and password
  pairs.  The basic authentication realm name used is
  <code>module_name.server_name</code>, where <code>module_name</code> is the name of the
  module containing the published objects and server_name is the name
  of the web server.</p>

<p>  The module used to publish an object may contain it's own
  <code>__allow_groups__</code> attribute, thereby limiting access to all of the
  objects in a module.</p>

<p>  If multiple objects in the URI path have <code>__allow_groups__</code>
  attributes, then the <code>__allow_groups__</code> attribute from the last
  object in the path that has this attribute will be used.  The
  <code>__allow_groups__</code> attribute for a subobject overrides
  <code>__allow_groups__</code> attributes for containing objects, however, if
  named groups are used, group data from containing objects may be
  inherited by contained objects.  If a published object uses named
  groups, then for each named group in the published object, group
  data from groups with the same name in contained objects will be
  inherited from container objects if:

<ul>
  <li>The contained object uses named groups,
  <li>There is no object that is a subobject of the container
       object, that is a container of the published object and that has
       unnamed groups.
</ul>
</p>


<p>  If the name of a group is the python object, <code>None</code>, then data from
  named groups in container objects will be inherited even if the
  grouped don't appear in the inheriting object, subject to the
  restrictions above.</p>

<p>  When group data are inherited, then inherited data is appended to
  the existing data.  When groups contain names and passwords,
  individual user names may have multiple passwords if they appear in
  multiple groups.</p>

<p>  Note that an object may have an <code>__allow_groups__</code> attribute that is
  set to None, in which case the object will be public, even if
  containing objects are not.</p>


<h2>Debugging and Testing</h2>

<p>Bobo provides some facilities to assist in tracking errors.  At the
base level, Bobo provides traceback information in the HTML that is
returned to the user. The traceback information is sent as an HTML
comment, so that the average user does not see it.</p>

<p>Also, Bobo provides some command-line facilities. There is a
<code>bobo.py</code> module that simulates that HTTP request, thus
recreating most of the environment of an actual request. This
command-line Bobo also provides:

<ul>
  
  <li> Extended integration with the Python debugger to allow skipping
to the point where a published object is actually called,
       
  <li> Providing username and passwords for protected operations,

  <li> Timing tests to measure performance, and

  <li> Integration with the Python profiler, generating a profiler
data file

</ul>
</p>


<h2>Related Services Integrated With Bobo</h2>

<p>We have invested serious time in using Bobo for fielding commercial
work. Along the way, we have tackled several other problem areas and
integrated their solutions with Bobo.</p>

<p>For instance, the area of dynamic generation of HTML is addressed
with our DocumentTemplate module.  These objects are particularly
integrated with Bobo, and have been designed to work with Bobo
features such as nested traversal of objects.</p>

<p>Also, our persistent object storage effort (affectionately
nicknamed Bobobase) is integrated. Specifically, other components are
ensured to be pickleable and to work with the transaction capabilities
of Bobobase.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>Below is a brief treatment of Bobo issues:

<ol>
  <li> Arguments are collected and passed in using metainfo available in
functions. The interface for this metainfo is not documented, and
Guido has asserted that it might be deprecated. However, the interface
has been discussed in the newsgroup.

  <li> Some interesting objects currently can have no metadata, except
docstrings. This means that Bobo applications have to adopt a
convention to provide method metainformation. For instance, there is a
special way to add docstrings to things that cannot have docstrings,
such as dictionaries. Also, the <code>__allow_groups__</code> for a
method is assigned outside the method, using a specially-named
variable.

  <li> The current behavior of Python's <code>getattr</code> has created some
curious Bobo hacks, specifically to support lazy access of persistent
data. Furthermore, the act of traversing a hierarchy of objects, as
represented by the URL, could be more tightly controlled using
improved attribute referencing.

  <li> Class attributes.

</ol>


<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Bobo is freely-available. It currently exists as a set of modules,
with some extensions for optimization (though the extensions are not
necessary). It has been heavily tested, in support of paid-for
applications.</p>

<p>However, there has been very little optimization. Currently, we
have a research project to add subclassable C types. The hope is that
several pieces of Bobo could be tightly-controlled in ways not
possible due to the issues raised above.</p>

<p>Finally, we are working on pushing Bobo out of the nest. This first
involves getting it working well on Windows. Also, we need to work on
our ILU support, and some of the other infrastructure items. As well,
we have a lot of documentation and proselytizing to do.</p>
