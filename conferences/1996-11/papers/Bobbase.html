<H1>Providing Persistence for <BR>
World-Wide-Web Applications </H1>

<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>
As applications evolve beyond simple document retrieval, the need
arises for efficient storage of persistent information that can
be managed through the World-Wide-Web (Web) by customers and end
users. We have developed a collection of modules that support
management of persistent objects on the Web. The modules build
on the Python pickle mechanism and provide support for:
<UL>
<LI>On-demand object activation,
<LI>Delay of loading object data until needed, to speed activation,
<LI>Support for persistent sub-objects that are retrieved and
updated independently from containing objects,
<LI>Management of multiple object versions and logging of object
changes,
<LI>Simple transaction management that rolls back object updates
when errors occur. 
</UL>

<P>
The modules currently use a very simple data format. All data
changes are made by appending new revisions to the end of a file,
reducing opportunities for file corruption.
<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>
Digital Creations, L.C., creates Web-based applications with rich
user interfaces and with many options that may be set by customers.
In the past, options were set in configuration files that were
read by applications on start-up. Similarly, customers could customize
the presentation of information by editing document templates.
This approach had a number of drawbacks:
<UL>
<LI>Editing of configuration files was non-intuitive and error
prone,
<LI>Editing of configuration files and document templates required
skill in using the Web-servers' file system.
<LI>Editing of configuration files and document templates required
access to the Web-servers' file system.
<LI>It was necessary to restart the application for changes to
have an effect, requiring either a Web-based interface to restart
the application or intervention by a host system administrator.

</UL>

<P>
Customers need to be able to make incremental changes to a system,
seeing the results of individual changes without changes being
visible to end-users. When customers are satisfied with a set
of changes, they need a way to make the changes &quot;live&quot;.
This capability amounts to a need for long-running transactions.
<P>
Customers want a way to be able to recover from mistakes made,
through some sort of &quot;oops&quot; facility.
<P>
Some applications use data sets that are periodically uploaded
by customers, such as classified ads or automotive dealer inventories.
This process typically involves several steps such as:
<UL>
<LI>Transferring raw data using a file transfer protocol,
<LI>Running conversion programs to convert raw data to a format
recognized by the application, and
<LI>Restarting the application to make new data available. 
</UL>

<P>
This process had most of the same problems as the process for
managing configuration files
<P>
To address the needs described above in a more effective manner,
we decided to investigate the use of a persistent object system
that could be used by applications to provide on-line configuration
and data management. It was desirable to find a solution that
would not incur the overhead of additional licensing fees or of
an extra software package that needed to be installed and managed.
The Python pickle mechanism provided much of what was needed to
develop a persistent object store, so we decided to attempt to
develop a pickle-based mechanism.
<H2>Requirements </H2>

<P>
To address the problem's described above, we set out to create
a system that would satisfy the following requirements:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Storage and retrieval of object data, using an object-oriented
mechanism </STRONG>
<DD>We did not want to have to define a series of database tables
to reflect the various types of objects in the system, because
we expected to have many different kinds of objects and we expected
data structures to change from time to time, and possibly from
object to object within the same class.
<DT><STRONG>Storage of multiple versions of the same object</STRONG>

<DD>This is needed to support long-running transactions and to
support reverting to earlier revisions.
<DT><STRONG>Separate activation, deactivation, and update of sub-objects</STRONG>
<DD>It is common for all of the objects in an application to be
connected in a single data structure. For example, an application
might include a collection of newspapers, each of which contains
a collection of automobile dealers, each of which has inventory,
and so on. It would be inefficient to load and update all of this
data at once.
<DT><STRONG>A simple yet robust file format that would survive
write errors and system failures. </STRONG>
<DD>The file format needed to be tolerant of various types of
failures without significant loss of data. For example, a write
error or system failure when writing or updating an individual
record should not cause other records to become inaccessible.
<DT><STRONG>Object identity</STRONG> 
<DD>Each object has a unique identifier within a persistent store
that supports reliable cross-object references, separate management
of sub-objects, and association between multiple revision of the
same object. 
</DL>

<H2>Approach </H2>

<P>
<IMG SRC="BobobaseArchitecture.GIF">
<P>
We have designed a collection of modules, called a Bobobase, that
build on the <EM>pickle</EM> module to provide keyed storage of
objects using a simple data format. The class architecture of
the system is shown in figure 1. 
<H3>Pickle Jars </H3>

<P>
At the heart of the mechanism is the <EM>PickleJar</EM> class
that manages the storage of picklable objects. When an object
is stored, it is converted to a pickle string and stored in a
simple database. When an object is retrieved, the pickle string
is retrieved from the simple database and unpickled. 
<P>
Every object stored in a pickle jar is assigned an object identifier
(OID). Persistent objects include this OID in their state. A pickle
jar provides a mapping interface that maps OIDs to objects. 
<H3>Persistent Objects </H3>

<P>
If an object is a subclass of the <EM>Persistent</EM> class, then
the storage and retrieval of the object occurs in two steps. When
the object is stored, the pickle string contains two pickles.
The first pickle includes the class and initial arguments for
the object, but not the object's state. The object's state is
stored in the second pickle. When the object is retrieved, the
pickle string is retrieved from the database and the first pickle
in the pickle string is used to restore the object using saved
initial arguments. Object state that is not captured through initial
arguments is not restored initially. Any state created by the
object's constructor is also hidden so that initial attempts to
access state will fail. When an attempt is first made to access
or update the object's state, the state will then be automatically
restored from the pickle jar. By deferring the loading of object
state in this manner, the loading of sub-objects is deferred until
needed.
<P>
Persistent objects have a <EM>__save__</EM> method that can be
called to update the state of the persistent object in a pickle
jar. Persistent objects keep track of state changes. If an object
has changed since the last time it was retrieved from or saved
in a pickle jar, then calling the __<EM>save</EM>__ method caused
the object to save it's updated state. When saving an object's
state, persistent sub-objects are not saved unless their state
has been changed or unless they have not yet been saved in the
pickle jar.
<H3>Transactions </H3>

<P>
Although persistent objects keep track of state changes, they
do not automatically save their state when changes occur. Changes
are not saved until the object's __<EM>save</EM>__ method is called.
For large object systems, it is not practical for an application
to explicitly call the __<EM>save</EM>__ method on all interesting
objects. To automate saving object state, a transaction mechanism
has been introduced.
<P>
A transaction is a sequence of operations, or program, that has
the following properties:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Serializability</STRONG> 
<DD>If there are multiple concurrently running transactions, the
results of the transactions are equivalent to results from the
same transactions run serially.
<DT><STRONG>Atomicity </STRONG>
<DD>A transaction either runs to completion, or any persistent
effects of the transaction are undone.
</DL>

<P>
These transaction properties make transactions extremely import
tools for providing reliable data management, because they free
the programmer from important details of concurrency control and
error recovery. 
<P>
The <EM>Transactional</EM> and <EM>Transaction Manager</EM> classes
are used to provide transaction semantics to persistent objects.
Objects that are subclasses of both <EM>Transactional</EM> and
<EM>Persistent</EM> have transactional semantics. When the state
of a transactional persistent object changes, the object automatically
registers itself with the current transaction manager. When a
transaction is committed, the _<EM>_inform_commit</EM>__ method
is called on any registered objects. This method, in turn, calls
the __<EM>save</EM>__ method on the registered objects. If a transaction
is aborted, then the <EM>__inform_abort__</EM> method is called
on registered objects. This causes any saved changes to be undone.
<P>
Transaction managers manage transactions. An application may have
a single transaction manager. When the transaction manager is
installed, a special function, <EM>get_transaction</EM>, is installed
in the __<EM>builtins</EM>__ module. The <EM>get_transaction</EM>
function retrieves a transaction object. The transaction object
has methods <EM>begin</EM>, <EM>commit</EM>, and <EM>abort</EM>
to begin, commit, or abort a transaction. These functions are
called by the application program. In the case of Python Object
Publisher (Bobo) applications, these routines are called automatically
by Bobo. At the beginning of each HTTP request, Bobo gets a transaction
and calls it's begin method. If the request is completed successfully,
then Bobo calls the transactions <EM>commit</EM> method, causing
all changes made during the request to be made permanent. If an
error occurs, the transactions <EM>abort</EM> method is called
to make sure that any changes made by the request are undone.
<P>
Transactional objects call a transaction's <EM>register</EM> method
to register the fact that their state has been changed by the
transaction.
<P>
To date, only one transaction manager, <EM>SingleThreadedTransaction</EM>,
has been implemented. As it's name implies, it has been designed
to support single-threaded applications. The module <EM>SingleThreadedTransaction</EM>
exports a <EM>Persistent</EM> class that is a subclass of the
<EM>Transactional</EM> class and the ordinary <EM>Persistent</EM>
class. 
<H3>Simple Databases </H3>

<P>
Pickle jars manage the storage and retrieval of objects using
a simple database that stores pickle strings. A simple database
is an object that maps OIDs to strings. Simple databases can be
implemented in a number of ways, such as:
<UL>
<LI>DBM databases
<LI>Relational databases with integer keys and binary large object
(BLOB) values
<LI>Directories with files that hold strings and that have OID-based
names 
</UL>

<P>
We have currently implemented a simple database, called a multiple
revision simple database (MRSDB) that stores pickle strings in
file records. Each revision of an object is stored in a different
record. Each record in a MRSDB contains several pieces of information:
<UL>
<LI>OID,
<LI>File position of the previous version of the object, or 0
if there are no previous versions, 
<LI>Starting time for the current revision, 
<LI>Length of the stored string, and
<LI>The stored string. 
</UL>

<P>
When an object is updated, a new record is added. The record containing
the previous version of object's pickle string is unchanged. This
approach has a number of advantages:
<UL>
<LI>A reading process or thread can read an object's value while
a separate writer process or thread is writing a new version.
<LI>If an error occurs or a process dies during a write, only
the new version of an object is lost.
<LI>It is easy to recover old versions of objects.
<LI>The data file serves as a transaction log. 
</UL>

<P>
A disadvantage of this approach is that file space for old revision
must be recovered through an explicit pack operation.
<P>
There is no separate index files. When a MRSDB is opened, an index
that maps OIDs to current revision file positions is built by
reading the header, or everything except the pickle string, from
each record. This approach has the advantage that there is no
separate index file to get out of synchronization with the data
file, however, it has the disadvantage that it may be time consuming
to read the record headers. In long-running processes, however,
long start-up times are not critical.
<H3>Caching </H3>

<P>
Pickle jars maintain a cache containing references to all retrieved
objects that are referenced by objects outside the cache. On every
access to the pickle jar, incremental garbage collection is performed
by removing objects from the cache whose reference counts have
dropped to one, and therefore are referenced only by the cache.
<P>
It is necessary to hold references to all living objects in the
cache so that database changes can be reflected in living objects.
<P>
Of course, use of a cache improves performance by preventing the
unpickling of objects on each access.
<H3>Pickle Dictionaries </H3>

<P>
Pickle jars provide a relatively low-level interface. Pickle jars
map OIDs to objects, but for many applications, it is much more
natural to map names to objects. Pickle dictionaries provide for
persistent storage of objects by key. For performance reasons,
keys are limited to marshalable objects.
<P>
In addition to providing persistent storage, pickle dictionaries
simplify the assembly of pickle jars and MRSDBs by providing a
simple constructor taking a file name to create or open a MRSDB,
and create associated pickle jars and dictionaries.
<H2>Usage </H2>

<P>
Using of this persistence mechanism is straightforward and, when
used with a transaction manager, nearly transparent. Application
classes must simply subclass from <EM>Transactional</EM> and <EM>Persistent</EM>.
Consider the <EM>Keywords</EM> class shown below which manages
persistent collections of keywords:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<FONT SIZE=1>from SingleThreadedTransaction import Persistent
from STPDocumentTemplate import HTMLFile
from PSA_Admin import admin_groups


dtml_dir='../private/'
MessageDialog=HTMLFile(dtml_dir+'MessageDialog.dtml')

class Keywords(Persistent):
    'PSA keywords'
    
    def __init__(self):
                self.items=[]

    manage__allow_groups__=admin_groups
    manage=HTMLFile(dtml_dir+'Keywords.dtml')
    manage_edit__allow_groups__=admin_groups
    def manage_edit(self, added=[], deleted=[], PARENT_URL=''):
                'change keywords'
                if deleted:
                           self.items=filter(lambda k, deleted=deleted:
                                 k not in deleted,
                                 self.items)
                if added:
                           self.items=self.items+filter(lambda k: k, added)
                           self.items.sort()
        
                return MessageDialog(
                           title='Keywords Successfully Updated',
                           message=(
                        '''
                        &lt;strong&gt;%s keywords were successfully added or deleted&lt;/strong&gt;
                        ''' % (len(added)+len(deleted))),
                           action=PARENT_URL+'/manage',
                           )

    def __len__(self): return len(self.items)
    def __getitem__(self,index): return self.items[index]

</FONT>
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the <EM>Keywords</EM> class implements a persistent
sequence of keywords. To be persistent, it was only necessary
to subclass. <EM>SingleThreadedTransaction.Persistent</EM>. <EM>SingleThreadedTransaction.Persistent</EM>
is a subclass of <EM>SingleThreadedTransaction.Transactional</EM>
and <EM>PickleDictionary.Persistent</EM>.
<P>
In addition to making sure that application classes are transactional
persistent, it is unfortunately necessary to assure that sub-objects
of application objects:
<UL>
<LI>Are transactional persistent, 
<LI>Are immutable, or 
<LI>Notify application classes of changes. 
</UL>

<P>
In the Keywords class above, the sub-object, <EM>items</EM>, is
mutable, but it is used immutably. All changes to the <EM>items</EM>
attribute are made by reassigning the attribute. This, in turn,
causes the <EM>Keywords</EM> object's change in state to be registered
with the transaction manager.
<P>
If one were to directly access and change a <EM>Keywords</EM>
object's <EM>items</EM> attribute, the change would not be persistent,
because list objects are not transactional persistent and the
change would not be registered with the transaction manager.
<P>
In addition to making sure that application classes are transactional
persistent, it is also necessary to store application objects
in pickle dictionaries or in transactional persistent objects
that have already been stored in dictionaries. Consider the example
below: 
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<FONT SIZE=1>import Keywords, Members
from SingleThreadedTransaction import PickleDictionary

DB=PickleDictionary(&quot;../private/var/PSA&quot;)

if not DB.has_key('Keywords'):
    DB['Keywords']=Keywords.Keywords()
    get_transaction().commit()

if not DB.has_key('Members'):
    DB['Members']=Members.Members()
    get_transaction().commit()

</FONT>
</PRE>

<P>
This example is taken from a from a module that constitutes the
&quot;main&quot; module for a Python Software Association (PSA)
Bobo application. This application defines a collection of modules
that provide PSA services such as defining PSA keywords, providing
a PSA membership directory, and so on. In the example, the modules
that provide keyword and membership services are imported. A pickle
dictionary is opened to hold persistent objects. If the pickle
dictionary did not exists before, then <EM>Keywords</EM> and <EM>Members</EM>
objects are created and placed in the pickle dictionary. 
<P>
Note that after placing each object in the pickle dictionary,
the current transaction is committed. This is necessary because
at the beginning of each HTTP request, Bobo begins a new transaction.
Any uncommitted changes made prior to calling the transaction
<EM>begin</EM> message are aborted, undoing the changes. Therefore
we commit the object additions to assure that they are permanent,
<P>
We have seen in an earlier example that the <EM>Keywords</EM>
class implements persistent sequences of keywords. The <EM>Members</EM>
class implements a collection of members. However, the <EM>Members</EM>
class implements a mapping from member identifiers to <EM>Member</EM>
objects. This allows individual members to be accessed through
Bobo. For example, to access member jim, one might use the URL:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<FONT SIZE=1>http://www.digicool.com/PSA/Members/jim

</FONT>
</PRE>

<P>
Here the persistent member, <EM>jim</EM>, is accessed in the persistent
collection of members, Members.
<P>
Persistent mappings are so commonly used that a class, PersistentMapping,
is exported by the SingleThreadedTransaction module to simplify
implementation.
<H2>Experience </H2>

<P>
Bobobase has been used in a number of Digital Creations products
including an automotive advertising product, a relational database
access product, and a demonstration product being developed for
the PSA. The use of Bobobase has greatly simplified application
development, has allowed us to provide applications with rich
through-the-Web configuration interfaces, and simplified product
installation.
<H2>Issues </H2>

<P>
A number of issues were encountered in this effort. These are
discussed below:
<H3>Extension types </H3>

<P>
Until recently, the pickle module did not provide support for
extension types. We provided a patch to the pickle module which
allows extension types to be pickled if they have __class__ attributes
that are bound to class-like objects that can be used to recreate
object instances. We are releasing an &quot;Extension Class&quot;
mechanism which will provide the needed behavior to extension
types that make use of it.
<H3>Detecting object access </H3>

<P>
To implement the lazy activation of objects described here, it
is necessary to know when an object is being accessed. This is
done in Bobobase by overriding __<EM>getattr</EM>__ and __<EM>setattr</EM>__
methods. Unfortunately for Bobobase, __<EM>getattr</EM>__ is called
only when a lookup fails. If an attribute can be obtained from
a class, then the classes value will be returned without calling
__<EM>getattr</EM>__. This can have serious consequences if the
not yet loaded state of an object has a value for the attribute.
<P>
To solve this problem will require re-implementing the persistence
mechanism as an extension class, since extension __<EM>getattr</EM>__
methods are always called. Implementing the persistence mechanism
as an extension will also overcome the performance cost of calling
a python __<EM>setattr</EM>__ function each time an attribute
is set. Work is underway on an &quot;Extension Class&quot; that
allows python classes to subclass from extension classes.
<P>
To help avoid this problem in Bobo applications, Bobo currently
takes steps to assure that any object encountered while traversing
a URL is activated.
<H3>Detecting sub-object changes </H3>

<P>
As mentioned earlier, problems can arise if persistent subobjects
have non-persistent mutable subobjects, because sub-object changes
might not be detected. A solution might be to restrict subobjects
to persistent or immutable objects and to enforce the restriction
with tests in __<EM>setattr</EM>__. Such a test might be quite
expensive in the current implementation, but may be feasible in
an extension-based implementation.
<H3>Deactivating objects </H3>

<P>
Currently, objects are automatically deactivated when they are
no longer referenced. It would be desirable to also deactivate
objects when they have not been used for some period of time.
Unfortunately, in the current implementation, it is impossible
to detect many object accesses, because the __<EM>getattr</EM>__
function is only called when normal attribute access fails. The
extension-based implementation will allow all access times to
be recorded. With access time information available, it will be
possible to add logic to the pickle jar cache to deactivate the
state of objects that have not been accessed in some period of
time. An extension-based cache implementation will also be needed
for efficiency.
<H3>Long startup time </H3>

<P>
In the current MRSDB implementation, the database index is constructed
when the file is opened. For long-running processes, the delay
associated with building this index is not problematic, however,
for short-running processes, such as CGI scripts, the time taken
to read large databases can be quite noticeable. Regular database
compaction can reduce the delay by reducing the number of record
headers that must be read. An extension-based implementation of
MRSDBs, or of the function that creates the index should reduce
startup time substantially. We also plan to cache header information
in a separate file that can be read on startup, so that only records
added since the cache was created need to be scanned. 
<H3>Multiple threads and long-running transactions </H3>

<P>
Although the MRSDB format should accommodate simultaneous reading
and writing, this feature has not been implemented. A design allowing
separate single writer and reader threads and supporting a simultaneous
long-running transaction and reads should be straightforward.
Allowing multiple simultaneous long-running transactions is a
bit more involved. We are considering a design using time-stamp
transaction protocols. 
<H3>Support for other data stores, such as relational databases
</H3>

<P>
Our largest customer has made a significant commitment to relational
database technology and would like to take advantage of their
investment in this technology. Relational database management
systems (RDBMSs) provide some significant advantages over our
home-grown Bobobase, such as:
<UL>
<LI>Support for distributed transactions,
<LI>More sophisticated recovery from system crashes and disk damage,
<LI>Higher transaction rates,
<LI>Support for complex and ad-hoc queries, 
</UL>

<P>
RDBMSs also have some disadvantages, such as:
<UL>
<LI>Lack of support for object-oriented programming, 
<LI>Lack of support for long-running transactions, 
<LI>Lack of support for versioning, and
<LI>Lack of support for keeping application objects up-to-date
with database changes. 
</UL>

<P>
We plan to investigate use of RDBMS tables as simple databases.
The biggest challenge may be detecting when objects in the database
have changed, so that in-memory objects can be updated.
<H3>MRSDB format issues </H3>

<P>
The MRSDB format provides most of the data needed to track changes
to a database, however, it would also be desirable to record user
names. Since all updates should be authenticated, user names should
be available.
<P>
To increase the survivability of MRSDBs to file corruption, we
plan to update the MRSDB data format to record string lengths
at the end of each record as well as in the record header.
<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>
Bobobase provides a nearly transparent mechanism for adding persistence
to Python applications. Support for transactional semantics provides
increased reliability. The open architecture provides room for
a number of extensions such as support for additional data storage
mechanisms.
<P>
Although we have not met all of our original requirements, namely
support for long running transactions, we expect to add this additional
functionality in the near future.<BR>
