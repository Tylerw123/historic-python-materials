<h2>Extension Classes, Python Extension Types Become Classes</h2>
<address>Jim Fulton, Digital Creations, L.C., jim@digicool.com</address>

<dl><dt><p><strong>Abstract</strong><p>
<dd><p>  A lightweight mechanism has been developed for making Python
  extension types more class-like.  Classes can be developed in an
  extension language, such as C or C++, and these classes can be
  treated like other python classes:</p>

<ul><li><p>They can be subclassed in python,</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>They provide access to method documentation strings, and</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>They can be used to directly create new instances.</p>

</ul>
<p>  Extension classes provide support for extended method binding
  protocols to support additional method types and additional method
  call sematics.</p>

<p>  An example class shows how extension classes are implemented and how
  they differ from extension types.</p>

<p>  Extension classes illustrate how the Python class mechanism can be
  extended and may provide a basis for improved or specialized class
  models. </p>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>Problem</strong><p>
<dd><p>  Currently, Python provides two ways of defining new kinds of objects:</p>

<ul><li><p>Python classes</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Extension types</p>

</ul>
<p>  Each aproach has it's strengths.  Extension types provide much greater
  control to the programmer and, generally, better performance.  Because
  extension types are written in C, the programmer has greater access to 
  external resources. (Note that Python's use of the term type has
  little to do with the notion of type as a formal specification.)</p>

<p>  Classes provide a higher level of abstraction and are generally much
  easier to develop.  Classes provide full inheritence support, while
  support for inheritence when developing extension types is very
  limited. Classes provide run-time meta-data, such as method doc
  strings, that are useful for documentation and discovery.  Classes
  act as factories for creating instances, while separate functions
  must be provided to create instances of types.</p>

<p>  It would be useful to combine the features of the two approaches.  It 
  would be useful to be able to have better support for inheritence for
  types, or to be able to subclass from types in Python.  It would be
  useful to be able to have class-like meta-data support for types and
  the ability to construct instances directly from types.</p>

<p>  We have need, in a number of projects, for semantics that are
  slightly different than the usual class semantics, yet we want to do
  most of our development in C.  For example, we have developed a
  persistence mechanism <a href="#1">[1]</a> that redefines <code>__getattr__</code> and
  <code>__setattr__</code> to take storage-related actions when object state is
  accessed or modified.  We want to be able to take certain actions on
  <em>every</em> attribute reference, but for python class instances,
  <code>__getattr__</code> is only called when attribute lookup fails by normal
  means.</p>

<p>  As another example, we would like to have greater control over how
  methods are bound.  Currently, when accessing a class
  instance attribute, the attribute value is bound together with the
  instance in a method object if and only if the attribute value is a
  python function.  For some applications, we might also want to be
  able to bind extension functions, or other types of callable
  objects, such as HTML document templates <a href="#2">[2]</a>. Furthermore,
  we might want to have greater control over how objects are bound.
  For example, we might want to bind instances and callable objects
  with special method objects that assure that no more than one thread
  accesses the object or method at one time.</p>

<p>  We can provide these special sematics in extension types, but we
  wish to provide them for classes developed in Python.</p>

<dl><dt><p><strong>Background</strong><p>
<dd><p>  At the first Python Conference, Don Beaudry presented work <a href="#3">[3]</a> done
  at V.I. Corp to integrate Python with C++ frameworks.  This system
  provided a number of important features, including:</p>

<ul><li><p>Definition of extension types that provide class-like meta-data
    and that can be called to create instances.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Ability to subclass in python from C types.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Ability to define classes in python who's data are stored as
    C structures rather than dictionaries to better interface to
    C and C++ libraries, and for better performance.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Less dynamic data structures.  In particular, the data structure
    for a class is described declaratively during class definition.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Support for enumeration types.</p>

</ul>
<p>  This work was not released, initially.</p>

<p>  Shortly after the workshop, changes were made to Python to support
  the subclassing features described in <a href="#3">[3]</a>.  These changes were not
  documented until recently <a href="#4">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>  At the third Python workshop, I presented some work I had done on
  generating module documentation for extension types.  Based on the
  discussion at this workshop, I developed a meta-type proposal <a href="#5">[5]</a>.
  This meta-type proposal was for an object that simply stored
  meta-information for a type, for the purpose of generating module
  documentation.</p>

<p>  In the summer of 1996, Don Beaudry released the system described in
  <a href="#3">[3]</a> under the name MESS <a href="#6">[6]</a>. MESS addresses a number of needs but
  has a few drawbacks:</p>

<ul><li><p>Only single inheritence is supported.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>The mechanisms for defining MESS extension types is very different
    from and more complicated than the standard Python type creation
    mechanism.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Defining MESS types requires the use of an extensive C
    applications programming interface.  This presents problems for
    configuraing dynamically-loaded extension modules unless the MESS
    library is linked into the Python interpreter.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Because the system tries to do a number of different things, it is
    fairly large, about 15,000 lines.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>There is very little documentation, especially for the C
    programming interface.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>The system is a work in progress, with a number of outstanding
    bugs.</p>

</ul>
<p>  As MESS matures, we expect most of these problems to be addressed.</p>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>Extension Classes</strong><p>
<dd><p>  To meet short term needs for a C-based persistence mechanism <a href="#1">[1]</a>, an
  extension class module was developed using the mechanism described
  in <a href="#4">[4]</a> and building on ideas from MESS <a href="#6">[6]</a>.  The extension class module
  recasts extension types as "extension classes" by seeking to
  eliminate, or at least reduce semantic differences between types and
  classes. The module was designed to meet the following goal:</p>

<ul><li><p>Provide class-like behavior for extension types, including
    interfaces for meta information and for contructing instances.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Support subclassing in Python from extension classes, with support
    for multiple inheritence.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Provide a small hardened implementation that can be used for
    current products.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Provide a mechanism that requires minimal modification to existing
    extension types.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Provide a basis for research on alternative semantics for classes
    and inheritence.</p>

</ul>
<dl><dt><p><strong>  Base extension classes and extension subclasses</strong><p>
<dd><p>    Base extension classes are implemented in C.  Extension subclasses
    are implemented in python and inherit, directly or indirectly from
    one or more base extension classes.  An extension subclass may
    inherit from base extension classes, extension subclasses, and
    ordinary python classes.  The usual inheritence order rules
    apply.  Currently, extension subclasses must conform to the
    following two rules:</p>

<ul><li><p>The first super class listed in the class statement defining an
      extension subclass must be either a base extension class or an
      extension subclass.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>At most one base extension direct or indirect super class may
      define C data members.  If an extension subclass inherits from
      multiple base extension classes, then all but one must be mix-in
      classes that provide extension methods but no data.</p>

</ul>

</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>  Meta Information</strong><p>
<dd><p>    Like standard python classes, extension classes have the following
    attributes containing meta-data:</p>

<dl><dt>    <code>__doc__</code>   <dd><p>a documentation string for the class,</p>

</dl>
<dl><dt>    <code>__name__</code>  <dd><p>the class name,</p>

</dl>
<dl><dt>    <code>__bases__</code> <dd><p>a sequence of base classes,</p>

</dl>
<dl><dt>    <code>__dict__</code>  <dd><p>a class dictionary.</p>

</dl>
<p>    The class dictionary provides access to unbound methods and their
    documentation strings, including extension methods and special
    methods, such as methods that implement sequence and numeric
    protocols.  Unbound methods can be called with instance first
    arguments.</p>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>  Subclass instance data</strong><p>
<dd><p>    Extension subclass instances have instance dictionaries, just
    like Python class instances do.  When fetching attribute values,
    extension class instances will first try to obtain data from the
    base extension class data structure, then from the instance
    dictionary, then from the class dictionary, and finally from base
    classes.  When setting attributes, extension classes first attempt
    to use extension base class attribute setting operations, and if
    these fail, then data are placed in the instance dictionary.</p>


</dl>

</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>Implementing base extension classes</strong><p>
<dd><p>  A base extension class is implemented in much the same way that an
  extension type is implemented, except:</p>

<ul><li><p>The include file, <code>ExtensionClass.h</code>, must be included.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>The type structure is declared to be of type <code>PyExtensionClass</code>, rather 
    than of type <code>PyTypeObject</code>.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>The type structure has an additional member that must be defined
    after the documentation string.  This extra member is a method chain
     <code>PyMethodChain</code>) containing a linked list of method definition
     <code>PyMethodDef</code>) lists.  Method chains can be used to implement
    method inheritence in C.  Most extensions don't use method chains,
    but simply define method lists, which are null-terminated arrays
    of method definitions.  A macro, <code>METHOD_CHAIN</code> is defined in
    <code>ExtensionClass.h</code> that converts a method list to a method chain.
    (See the example below.)</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Module functions that create new instances must be replaced by an
    <code>__init__</code> method that initializes, but does not create storage for 
    instances.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>The extension class must be initialized and exported to the module
    with::</p>
<p>        PyExtensionClass_Export(d,"name",type);</p>

<p>    where <code>name</code> is the module name and <code>type</code> is the extension class
    type object.</p>


</ul>
<dl><dt><p><strong>  Attribute lookup</strong><p>
<dd><p>    Attribute lookup is performed by calling the base extension class
    <code>getattr</code> operation for the base extension class that includes C
    data, or for the first base extension class, if none of the base
    extension classes include C data.  <code>ExtensionClass.h</code> defines a
    macro <code>Py_FindAttrString</code> that can be used to find an object's
    attributes that are stored in the object's instance dictionary or
    in the object's class or base classes:</p>
<XMP>
       v = Py_FindAttrString(self,name);

</XMP>

<p>    In addition, a macro is provided that replaces <code>Py_FindMethod</code>
    calls with logic to perform the same sort of lookup that is
    provided by <code>Py_FindAttrString</code>.</p>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>  Linking</strong><p>
<dd><p>    The extension class mechanism was designed to be useful with
    dynamically linked extension modules.  Modules that implement
    extension classes do not have to be linked against an extension
    class library.  The macro <code>PyExtensionClass_Export</code> imports the
    <code>ExtensionClass</code> module and uses objects imported from this module
    to initialize an extension class with necessary behavior.</p>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>  Example: MultiMapping objects</strong><p>
<dd><p>    As an example, consider an extension class that implements a
    "MultiMapping". A multi-mapping is an object that encapsulates 0
    or more mapping objects.  When an attempt is made to lookup an
    object, the encapsulated mapping objects are searched until an
    object is found.</p>

<p>    Consider an implementation of a MultiMapping extension type,
    without use of the extension class mechanism:</p>

<p>    This module defines an extension type, <code>MultiMapping</code>, and exports a
    module function, <code>MultiMapping</code>, that creates <code>MultiMapping</code>
    Instances. The type provides two methods, <code>push</code>, and <code>pop</code>, for
    adding and removing mapping objects to the multi-mapping.
    The type provides mapping behavior, implementing mapping length
    and subscript operators but not mapping a subscript assignment
    operator.</p>

<p>    This version includes <code>ExtensionClass.h</code>.  The two declarations of
    <code>MMtype</code> have been changed from <code>PyTypeObject</code> to <code>PyExtensionClass</code>.
    The <code>METHOD_CHAIN</code> macro has been used to add methods to the end of
    the definition for <code>MMtype</code>.  The module function, newMMobject has
    been replaced by the <code>MMtype</code> method, <code>MM__init__</code>.  Note that this
    method does not create or return a new object.  Finally, the lines:</p>
<XMP>
      d = PyModule_GetDict(m);
      PyExtensionClass_Export(d,"MultiMapping",MMtype);

</XMP>

<p>    Have been added to both initialize the extension class and to export
    it in the module dictionary.</p>

<p>    To use this module, compile, link, and import it as with any other
    extension module.  The following python code illustrates the
    module's use:</p>
<XMP>
      from MultiMapping import MultiMapping
      m=MultiMapping()
      m.push({'spam':1, 'eggs':2})
      m.push({'spam':3, 'ham':4})

      m['spam'] # returns 3
      m['ham']  # returns 4
      m['foo']  # raises a key error

</XMP>

<p>    Creating the <code>MultiMapping</code> object took three steps, one to create
    an empty <code>MultiMapping</code>, and two to add mapping objects to it.  We
    might wish to simplify the process of creating MultiMapping
    objects by providing a constructor that takes source mapping
    objects as parameters.  We can do this by subclassing MultiMapping
    in Python:</p>
<XMP>
      from MultiMapping import MultiMapping
      class ExtendedMultiMapping(MultiMapping):
          def __init__(self,*data):
            MultiMapping.__init__(self)
            for d in data: self.push(d)

      m=ExtendedMultiMapping({'spam':1, 'eggs':2}, {'spam':3, 'ham':4})

      m['spam'] # returns 3
      m['ham']  # returns 4
      m['foo']  # raises a key error

</XMP>

<dl><dt><p><strong>Bindable objects</strong><p>
<dd><p>  Python classes bind Python function attributes into methods.  When a
  class has a function attribute that is accessed as an instance
  attribute, a method object is created and returned that contains
  references to the original function and instance.  When the method
  is called, the original function is called with the instance as the
  first argument followed by any arguments passed to the bethod.</p>

<p>  Extension classes provide a similar mechanism for attributes that
  are Python functions or inherited extension functions.  In addition,
  if an extension class attribute is an instance of an extension class
  that defines <code>__call__</code> and <code>__bind_to_object__</code> methods, then when
  the attribute is accessed through an instance, it's
  <code>__bind_to_object__</code> method will be called to create a bound method.</p>

<p>  Consider the following example:</p>
<XMP>
    import ExtensionClass

    class foo(ExtensionClass.Base):

      def __call__(self,ob): print 'called', ob

      class meth:

        def __init__(self,m,o): self.meth, self.ob=m,o

        def __call__(self): self.meth(self.ob)

      def __bind_to_object__(self,o): return self.meth(self,o)

    class bar(ExtensionClass.Base):
      hi=foo() # bar has a foo method named hi

    x=bar()
    hi=x.hi()

</XMP>

<p>  Note that <code>ExtensionClass.Base</code> is a base extension class that
  provides no function other than creating extension subclasses.  It
  is used here to allow extension classes to be defined totally in
  python to take advantage of the binding mechanism.</p>

<p>  When run, this program outputs: 'called <bar instance at 140046420>'</p>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>Status</strong><p>
<dd><p>  The current release of the extension class module is 0.3 <a href="#Download">[Download]</a>. The
  implementation is about two thousand lines in size, including
  comments.  This release will work with Python verion 1.3 or 1.4, but
  does not take advantage of attribute access optimizations available
  in Python 1.4.  </p>

<dl><dt><p><strong>  Installation</strong><p>
<dd><dl><dt><p><strong>      Dynamic linking installation</strong><p>
<dd><p>        Installation is in two steps.  First, run <code>make</code> to build the
        extension class module, and then run <code>make</code> with a target of
        <code>install</code> to install the <code>ExtensionClass</code> module and the
        <code>ExtensionClass.h</code> header file in the standard python
        directories.  For Python revision 1.4 and higher, use the default
        make file:</p>
<XMP>
           make
           make install

</XMP>

<p>        for Python 1.3, use the make file, <code>1.3-Makefile</code>:</p>
<XMP>
           make -f 1.3-Makefile
           make -f 1.3-Makefile install

</XMP>

<p>        Note that the make files can also be used to build the sample
        extension class module, MultiMapping:</p>
<XMP>
           make MODULE=MultiMapping

</XMP>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>      Static linking installation</strong><p>
<dd><p>        To statically link the extension class module into the Python
        interpreter:</p>
<ul><li><p>copy the files: <code>ExtensionClass.c</code> and <code>ExtensionClass.h</code> to
              the <code>Modules</code> directory in the Python source tree,</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>add the following line to the <code>Setup</code> file in the <code>Modules</code>
              directory::</p>
<p>                ExtensionClass ExtensionClass.c</p>


</ul>
<ul><li><p>rebuild python, and</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>copy <code>ExtensionClass.h</code> to the Python run-time include
              directory,</p>

</ul>


</dl>

</dl>

</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>Issues</strong><p>
<dd><p>  There are a number of issues that came up in the course of this work
  and that deserve mention.</p>

<ul><li><p>Currently, the class extension mechanism described in <a href="#4">[4]</a> requires
    that the first superclass in a list of superclasses must be of the
    extended class type.  This may not be convenient if mix-in
    behavior is desired.  If a list of base classes starts with a
    standard python class, but includes an extension class, then an
    error is raised.  It would be more useful if, when a list of base
    classes contains one or more objects that are not python classes,
    the first such object was used to control the extended class
    definition.  To get around this, the <code>ExtensionClass</code> module exports
    a base extension class, <code>Base</code>, that can be used as the first base
    class in a list of base classes to assure that an extension
    subclass is created.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Currently, only one base extension class can define any data in
    C.  The data layout of subclasse instances is the same as for the
    base class that defines data in C, except that the data structure
    is extended to hold an instance dictionary.  The data structure
    begins with a standard python header, and extension methods expect
    the C instance data to occur immediately after the object header.  If
    two or more base classes defined C data, the methods for the
    different base classes would expect their data to be in the same
    location. A solution might be to allocate base class instances and
    store pointers to these instances in the subclass data structure.
    The method binding mechanism would have to be a more complicated
    to make sure that methods were bound to the correct base data
    structure. </p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>There is currently no support for subclassing in C, beyond that
    provided by method chains..  </p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Rules for mixed-type arithmetic are different for python class
    instances than they are for extension type instances.  Python
    classes can define right and left versions of numeric binary
    operators, or they can define a coersion operator for converting
    binary operator operands to a common type.  For extension types,
    only the latter, coersion-based, approach is supported.  The
    coersion-based approach does not work well for many data types for
    which coersion rules depend on the operator.  Because extension
    classes are based on extension types, they are currently limited
    to the coersion-based approach.  It would be straightforward to
    extend the extension class implementation to allow both types of
    mixed-type arithmetic control.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>I considered making extension classes immutable, meaning that
    class attributes could not be set after class creation.  I also
    considered making extension subclasses cache inherited
    attributes.  Both of these are related and attractive for some
    applications, however, I decided that it would be better to retain
    standard class instance sematics and provide these features as
    options at a later time.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>It would be useful to be able to specify parameters that control
    class creation, but that would otherwise not appear in the class
    dictionary.  For example, it would be useful to provide parameters
    to control mutability of classes (not class instances), or to
    turn on caching of inherited class attributes.</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>The extension class module defines new method types to bind C and
    python methods to extension class instances.  It would be useful
    for these method objects to provide access to function call
    information, such as the number and names of arguments and the
    number of defaults, by parsing extension function documentation
    strings.</p>

</ul>

</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>Applications</strong><p>
<dd><p>  Aside from test and demonstration applications, the extension class
  mechanism has been used to provide an extension-based implementation
  of the persistence mechanism described in <a href="#1">[1]</a>.  We plan to develop
  this further to provide features such as automatic deactivation of
  objects not used after some period of time and to provide more
  efficient peristent-object cache management.</p>

<p>  Future projects include creation of Java-like synchronized objects
  and impementation of aquisition <a href="#7">[7]</a>, an inheritence-like mechansism
  that provides attribute sharing between container and component
  objects. </p>


</dl>
<dl><dt><p><strong>Summary</strong><p>
<dd><p>  The extension-class mechanism described here provides a way to add
  class services to extension types.  It allows:</p>
<ul><li><p>Subclassing extension classes in Python,</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Construction of extension class instances by calling extension
      classes,</p>

</ul>
<ul><li><p>Extension classes to provide meta-data, such as unbound methods
      and their documentation string.</p>

</ul>

<p>  In addition, the extension class module provides a relatively
  concise example of the use of mechanisms that were added to Python
  to support MESS <a href="#6">[6]</a>, and that were described at the fourth Python
  Workshop <a href="#4">[4]</a>.  It is hoped that this will spur research in improved
  and specialized models for class implementation in Python.</p>
