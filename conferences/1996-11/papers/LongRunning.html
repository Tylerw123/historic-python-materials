       Dramatic performance gains can be gained by avoiding long
       startup times associated with Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
       applications, especially when a large number of Python modules
       are used. Avoiding startup overhead is even more important when 
       expensive connections to external persistent data stores are
       required.  Management of persistent data is simplified if only
       one process is accessing the data.  This paper discusses
       strategies for implementing long-running World-Wide Web
       applications and experience with three of these strategies.

<P><BIG><BIG>Introduction</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
As widespread usage of the Web continues to grow, the deployment of dynamic Web 
applications is quickly displacing the publishing of static content in many 
organizations' Internet strategies.  The use of Python and other high-level scripting 
languages with CGI allow very rapid application development. However, many organizations 
are finding CGI insufficient for providing the performance required to implement more complex  
applications. Lack of CGI support for long-running processes incurs large performance 
penalties on applications with high initialization overhead or which need to establish 
connections to enterprise data sources. Web applications often must be designed around 
the constraints of CGI rather than designed to the requirements of the problem to be solved. 
In fact, some designs simply cannot be reasonably implemented in a standard CGI environment.
</P>

<P>
Several strategies for achieving connectivity with long-running processes exist, 
notably:
<DL>
<DT> <BR><B>Web server API integration</B>
<DD> Many popular Web servers provide a server API which can be used to 
     route HTTP requests to long-running processes. The method used to route 
     requests, however, must be implemented by the application developer. 
     This strategy can provide 
     very high-performance, but at a cost. Most server APIs are not compatible, 
     and applications written to a specific API lose the general portability afforded 
     by CGI. Portability may be further constrained by the IPC mechanism used to provide 
     connectivity to the long-running process. API applications generally must be written 
     in C, requiring a more significant development effort than would be the case if 
     Python or another RAD language could be used. Finally, bugs in applications written 
     directly to a server API can introduce instabilities in the server itself, which is 
     a problem for sites requiring high availability.
     <P>
     Digital Creations' ILU Requester provided long-running process support by hooking 
     a Web server API and attempting to minimize the restrictions imposed on the Web 
     application. As we shall see, however, the problems associated with writing directly to 
     a server API kept this strategy from being a viable architecture for publishing long-running 
     applications through the Web.
     </P>

<DT> <BR><B>Open Market's FastCGI</B>
<DD> Open Market's FastCGI <A HREF="#FCGI">[1]</A> can provide connectivity to 
     long-running processes as well as simulate standard CGI. FastCGI is compatible 
     with applications written in Python and other common CGI scripting languages,
     and generally does not require that applications be FastCGI-aware. FastCGI
     is an open protocol, though implementations are currently only available for 
     Open Market, Apache, and NCSA Web servers. As of this writing, no implementations 
     are available for Windows platforms. The FastCGI standard also defines 
     several &quot;roles&quot; available to a Web application other than the traditional 
     &quot;Responder&quot; role, which can allow an application to log requests or perform 
     authorization rather than respond to HTTP requests directly.

<DT> <BR><B>Digital Creations' Persistent CGI</B>
<DD> Persistent CGI (PCGI) is a simple, lightweight mechanism that allows HTTP requests
     to be handled by long-running Python processes (though most any scripting language
     could easily implement PCGI support). PCGI is designed to work on any Web server 
     that supports standard CGI, and requires no specific support on the part of a Web 
     application. PCGI also provides support for Digital Creations' Python Object Publisher 
     system.

<P>
Digital Creations has developed a number of Python-based Web applications which 
have required long-running process support. In the course of development, we have 
used several variations of the strategies above. Following is a discussion of each 
strategy and it's usefulness in implementing high performance Web applications.
</P>





<BR>
<P><BIG><BIG>Inter-Language Unification (ILU) Requester</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
Digital Creations' ILU Requester <A HREF="#REQUESTER">[2]</A> was our first attempt 
to provide Web connectivity to Python applications using ILU <A HREF="#ILU">[3]</A>.
The ILU Requester is implemented as a server API mechanism which allows ILU object 
servers to be registered with the Web server. Published Python objects
which implement the HTTP ISL via Digital Creations' wwworb <A HREF="#HTTPISL">[4]</A> 
abstraction become Web-accessible resources with a minimum of direct ILU support 
in the application.
</P>

<P>
ILU provides a number of powerful features including the ability to use many different 
communication abstractions (TCP, RPC, DCOM, IIOP), broad platform support, and advanced 
features like distributed garbage collection. With support for higher-level RAD languages 
such as Python, these features qualify ILU as a natural component for creating robust, 
widely interoperable Web-based solutions.
</P>

<P>
The ILU Requester was compelling in that it offered the possibility of publishing
both local and remote objects, written in any ILU-supported language. It also provided 
a standard development interface via the HTTP ISL which made it easy to implement 
frameworks and abstractions to keep the specifics of ILU out of application code. 
While the HTTP interface allowed applications to avoid dealing with the mechanics of an 
HTTP request, writing to the interface dictated certain aspects of the design of the 
application. This design did not allow Python programs to leverage native Python types, 
though HTTP itself is typeless.
</P>

<P>
In the course of releasing commercial software using these technologies, it became 
apparent that the weakness of the ILU Requester is in it's Web server API integration. The 
APIs provided by various Web server vendors vary greatly, making it extremely 
difficult to provide Requester implementations for a wide range of servers and 
platforms. While HTTP ISL / wwworb applications written in Python are well insulated from server/platform 
issues, maintaining Requesters compatible with numerous versions of many popular 
Web server APIs quickly became a resource drain.

ILU continues to have intriguing possibilities as a 
component in distributed high-performance Web architecture, but clearly a more portable 
and maintainable implementation than was achieved with the Requester is required.
</P>







<BR>
<P><BIG><BIG>FastCGI</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
FastCGI appeared at roughly the same time that we were looking for a more 
Web server-independent application architecture.
In addition to providing connectivity to long-running Web applications, FastCGI 
provides other features such as process control, and allows applications to service 
HTTP requests indirectly in Authorization or Logging roles. We used Open Market's 
Secure Web Server to evaluate FastCGI and attempted to port one of our existing ILU Requester 
based applications to use it.
</P>
<P>
FastCGI, from a Python application perspective, works by replacing the low-level 
stdin / stdout /stderr implementation used by the application with an implementation 
that uses the FastCGI protocol to pass requests between Web server and application.
This method allows streaming of data from an application back to the 
HTTP client, which offers greater perceived performance for applications such as 
search engines, which may return large result sets.

As it uses TCP sockets as its IPC mechanism, it is possible to build distributed 
applications using FastCGI. The FastCGI specification describes an ambitious architecture 
which allows for multi-threaded application architectures and future additions to the 
&quot;roles&quot; a FastCGI application may perform. Open Market 
sells several Web server products which offer FastCGI support, and as of this writing offers 
patch modules for NCSA httpd 1.5.2 and Apache  which add support for FastCGI on those servers.
</P>

<P>
A useful feature of FastCGI is it's ability to perform automatic process control on 
long-running applications. FastCGI aware Web servers can be configured to automatically restart 
stalled or crashed applications. This is particularly important for long-running applications 
which may use external libraries where instabilities or resource leakage are out of the developer's 
control. A consistent method of starting Web processes is also easier on the end users of the 
application.
</P>

<P>
It proved very easy to transition our Python based long running chat server application 
to FastCGI as it was based on our wwworb Request/Response abstractions. In testing of the 
application it was found that there were size limitations on the amount of data that could 
be returned by a Web application which, if exceeded, would cause the active Web server thread 
to block other server threads. Under heavy load conditions, a server thread returning a large amount 
of data to a slow client on a 14.4Kbps modem connection can cause significant overall performance 
degradation due to the blocking issue. This is largely an implementation issue that surely will 
be addressed in time, but at present the blocking issue potentially negates any performance 
increases gained by using a long-running process. As commercial application developers, the 
currently small number of Web servers which offer FastCGI support was an issue for us. There 
is a feeling in the community that a Win32 port of FastCGI would be difficult. The prospects 
for Win32 support for FastCGI applications, at least in the near term, seems unclear. 
The combination of these factors led us to conclude that FastCGI is not yet a solid 
foundation for our long-running Web solutions.
</P>



<BR>
<P><BIG><BIG>Persistent CGI</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
Needing a workable, server-independent solution to the problem of connecting to 
long-running processes through the Web, Digital Creations developed Persistent CGI (PCGI) as 
the simplest working solution to publishing Python applications. PCGI, used with the Python 
Object Publisher <A HREF="#PYTHON_OBJECT_PUBLISHER">[5]</A>, provides a transparent, high-performance solution for publishing long-running 
services.
It is a less ambitious solution than FastCGI or the ILU Requester systems, but offers 
similar performance benefits while remaining Web server independent. 
</P>

<P>
  Persistent CGI allows a long running process to be published via the WWW
  on any server which supports CGI, and requires no specific support
  in the published application (beyond the fact that the design of the
  application will reflect the intent that the application be a long-
  running process).  Persistent CGI works by providing a "publisher" component,
  which initiates the application and listens for incoming requests, and
  a "wrapper" component which is essentially a very lightweight, optimized CGI
  program (written in C). The wrapper passes HTTP requests to the long-running process
  via a simple protocol, and returns the application's response.
</P>

<P>
PCGI also provides rudimentary process control. An installed PCGI application is actually started 
by the wrapper component which handles the first CGI request to the application. The wrapper, 
for speed purposes, will immediately attempt to connect to the target application upon execution by the 
Web server. If, however, the wrapper finds that it cannot connect, it will attempt to 
restart the resource, wait for it to initialize and re-attempt a connection. 
(If at this point the connection still can't be made, an error is assumed and an appropriate 
message returned to the client.)
</P>

<P>
<DL>
<DT> <B>The PCGI &quot;Wrapper&quot;</B>
<DD> A very lightweight &quot;wrapper&quot; process which is instantiated by and captures 
     the CGI request from  the Web server. The wrapper uses a small text file to determine 
     the necessary information to connect to the target process via an IPC mechanism appropriate 
     for the platform (currently UNIX sockets on Unix, INET sockets on Win32). After establishing 
     a connection to the process, the wrapper relays the CGI request and buffers the response before 
     terminating the connection to the process. Finally the wrapper rebuilds the CGI response, returning 
     it to the Web server via the normal stdout and stderr.



<DT> <BR><B>The PCGI &quot;Publisher&quot;</B>
<DD> The PCGI Publisher is a Python module which is actually used to start the long-running process, 
     providing the necessary mechanisms to listen for connections from PCGI wrapper processes. Upon 
     receiving a PCGI request, the publisher builds the request into a dictionary containing the enviroment 
     and a File object containing stdin . The PCGI Publisher passes the rebuilt CGI request to the Python Module Publisher, 
     which performs namespace resolution, calls the appropriate object or method, and stores the response into 
     two File objects representing stdout and stderr. The publisher then converts the captured stdout and stderr objects 
     to a PCGI stream, sending it to the wrapper before terminating it's end of the connection and 
     waiting for a new request.
</DL>
<BR>

The integration of PCGI with the Python Object Publisher allows application code to remain 
completely independent of the method used to contact it. The generation of the PCGI information 
file used by the wrapper executable is able to be pushed out to installation utilities, and 
the entire IPC mechanism could be changed at a later time without affecting application logic. 
(This is in fact the case on Win32 platforms which do not support UNIX domain sockets.)




<P>
<BR>
Initial tests indicate that Persistent CGI provides performance similar to 
 server API or FastCGI based solutions. By buffering the requests and responses
of a PCGI application, the wrapper minimizes the time the application actually spends servicing 
a request, and provides immunity from any buffering quirks of the particular Web server in use. 

The fact that the wrapper, no matter how fast or light, still causes some small amount of CGI overhead 
is made up for in that:
<UL>
<LI> the application can run on a much broader range of servers and platforms
<LI> per-request overhead is finite and constant, unrelated to the application
</UL>
</P>

<BR>
With a powerful application abstraction layer such as the Python Object Publisher, 
PCGI can achieve much better performance than common CGI without sacrificing portability. 
The external nature of PCGI allows for future improvement or extension without affecting 
application code. It could in fact be implemented as a Web server API mechanism for 
certain high-load applications, providing further performance increases and lower system 
overhead.

As the distributed object world matures and the Web continues to move from content to 
code, multi-tiered abstractions such as the combination of PCGI and the Python Object 
Publisher provide the basis for future interoperability. These abstractions could allow the 
incorporation of ILU, IIOP, DCOM, or other emerging 
technologies to publish robust, complex systems with a minumum of effort. It is easy to 
envision a Python Object Publisher that allows a single long-running resource to respond to 
requests via both HTTP and IIOP (or any combination of protocols!) while maintaining a single, 
unaffected codebase. Recent trends toward the deployment of client-side objects make these 
possibilities even more compelling.
