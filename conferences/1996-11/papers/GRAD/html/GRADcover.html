<h4><a name="HDR1">Abstract</a></h4>

<p><em>The <i>Grammar-based Rapid Application Development</i> (GRAD)
system is an interface generator between Python and legacy
languages. To allow the interface generator to work with multiple
languages, the interface is based upon a grammar for a given
language. Currently, the C++ language has had its interface compiler
created and successfully emits the necessary binding code to make C++
code accessible from Python.</em></p>

<p><em>The GRAD process is non-intrusive so the legacy code does not
have to be modified in order for the interface to work. No
superclasses or include files are added to the existing code and
changes in the interface generator system itself do not require
changes in the legacy code. Changes in the target legacy code
naturally requires the regeneration of the interface but no manual
editing of the generated interface is needed, so the interface
generation can be made part of the build process.</em></p>

<p><em>Using GRAD, the promise of entire new applications written
rapidly in the high level language Python is attainable while still
preserving much of the operational advantages of, and investments in,
existing compiled and tested code.</em></p>
