       Text-search engines provide the ability to quickly search for
       documents that contain terms in textual data.  Commercial
       text-search engines provide many capabilities but often have
       large overhead in process size, application complexity, and
       licensing cost.  We have developed a Python module,
       InvertedIndex, that has a simple Python Application Programming
       Interface and that provides support for incremental indexing
       and for stopword, synonym, and stemming databases.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    The problem of document storage and retrieval has always been a major 
    issue in Computer Science.  One of the most popular techniques of
    information retrieval has been the use of inverted indices, the method
    used by most commercial indexing software companies.
    <p>
    An inverted index catalogs a collection of objects in their
    textual representations.  Given a set of documents, keywords and other
    attributes (possibly including relevance ranking) are assigned
    to each document.  The inverted index is the list of keywords and
    links to the corresponding document.  Frequently there are several
    restrictions which limit the keywords in an index.  Examples include:
    <ul>
        <li> A collection of stopwords--keywords that are not considered
             relevant.  This collection normally contains words considered
             too common to function as keywords (articles, prepositions,
             conjunctions, etc.) or words outside the context of the index.
        <li> A set of rules that define keywords in a document.  This controls
             the manner in which keywords are found.  For instance, keywords
             might be defined as character sequences surrounded by white-
             space.
        <li> A set of rules that restrict indexable words.  For instance, a
             rule that causes keywords containing numbers not to be indexed.
        <li> A collection of "synonyms"--keywords that should be indexed using
             a different keyword.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The InvertedIndex module provides simple tools for creating and
    maintaining inverted indices with support for incremental indexing and
    for stopword, synonym and stemming databases.
    <p>

    <p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <dl>
      <dd><h3>Lexical Analysis for Indexing</h3>
	  Lexical analysis is the process of converting text input into
	  a group of words or tokens.  Common issues include handling of
	  hyphenated words, punctuation, digits and case.  InvertedIndex
	  provides basic functionality for addressing these issues and
	  is configurable for special behavior.  By default, InvertedIndex
	  de-hyphenates all words and treats groups of alphabetic
	  characters as words, using whitespace and punctuation as a
	  keyword delimiter.  The words are converted to lowercase as
	  they are indexed.
	   
      <dd><h3>Stopwords</h3>
          The stopword list is a group of keywords which should not be
	  indexed. It is comprised of keywords that are considered irrelevant 
          to the index--keywords considered too common or non-specific 
          to be useful as search items.  Common stopwords include articles,
          prepositions and one-letter words.
	  <p>
	  At index time, keywords are compared the words in the stopword list;
	  any keyword found in the stopword list is not indexed.  Stopword
	  lists can dramatically reduce the size of the index, decreasing
	  the overall search time.  Since irrelevant words are not included
	  in the index, search results are likely to be more meaningful in
	  the context of the user's query.

      <dd><h3>Stemming</h3>
	  Stemming is a method of providing users with the ability to
	  execute a search on a word using an alternate grammatical form,
	  such as tense and person.  Rather than using an automatic stemming
	  algorithm to create the stems, InvertedIndex uses a table-lookup
	  method, storing the stems along with the index in a Python
	  dictionary.  While the table-lookup method is costly in terms of
	  storage space, it allows for quicker indexing and greater control
	  over the formation of stems.
          <p>
	  The following is an example of a mapping of keywords to their
	  corresponding stem keywords:<br><br>
            <dl>
              <dd>running -> run
              <dd>runner  -> run
              <dd>swims   -> swim
              <dd>swam    -> swim<br><br>
            </dl>
          At index time, keywords for which a stem is given will be indexed
	  as the stem keyword, not as the original keyword.  Stemming is
	  helpful in reducing the size of the index files.  However, it
	  can also negatively affect the speed of retrieval if the stemming
	  database is large.  
	    
      <dd><h3>Synonyms</h3>
	  A synonym database can be constructed to search on words with
	  equivalent meanings.  Synonyms are implemented exactly as stems,
	  the only distinction is that keywords are mapped to words with
	  the same meaning as opposed to different grammatical forms of
	  the keyword.  
	  <p>
	  The following is an example of a mapping of keywords to their
	  corresponding synonyms:<br><br>
            <dl>
              <dd>car        -> vehicle
              <dd>automobile -> vehicle
              <dd>plane      -> vehicle<br><br>
            </dl>
	    
          Keywords for which a synonym is given will be indexed as the
          synonym keyword, not as the original keyword.  As with stemming,
	  synonyms can reduce the size of the index, but can also slow
	  the indexing and searching time.
	    
      <dd><h3>Persistence</h3>
          Persistent indices allow for quick retrieval of previously
          indexed information. Persistence is achieved through use of
	  the Python pickle module.  This feature allows an index
	  to be saved to disk and later restored, avoiding having to
	  reindex data.
	  <p>
	  Persistent indices are provided through the
	  InvertedIndex module's Persistent and Transactional classes.
	  The Persistent class keeps track of whether the index has
	  changed, saving the object's data when necessary.  The
	  Transactional class provides a transactional model for
	  persistency:  changes to an index are only saved at the
	  completion of a 'transaction', a single, complete operation on the
	  index.  The value of the transactional model is that is insures
	  that no portion of an aborted indexing attempt is saved.

      <dd><h3>Relevance Ranking</h3>
          Keywords are assigned a relevance ranking, which is the calculation
          of a keyword's frequency relative to the total number of words in
	  the document.  InvertedIndex assigns ranking based on the following
	  formula: <p>
	             <pre>   O / log(T)</pre>
	  where O represents the number of occurrences of a single keyword
	  and T represents the total number of keywords in the document.
	  <p>
	  The relevance rank aids the end-user in locating the desired
	  information by indicating which results (especially in a large
	  result set) are more likely yield pertinent information.

      <dd><h3>Query Language</h3>
	  A separate module, InvertedIndexQuery, provides a simple query
	  language for use with InvertedIndex.  InvertedIndexQuery supports
	  "and", "or", and "not" operators on search terms as well as the use
	  of parentheses for association.  The following examples illustrate
	  several inverted index queries along with explanations with their
	  functions.
	  <table>
	    <th>Query<th>Result
	    <tr>
	      <td>"Python"
	      <td>Documents containing the word "Python"
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td>"Python or spam"
	      <td>Documents containing either the word "Python" or the
	          word "spam"
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td>"Python and not Perl"
	      <td>Documents containing the word "Python", but not the word
	          "Perl"
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td>"not (Pascal or Perl)"
	      <td>Documents that contain neither of the words "Pascal" or
	          "Perl"
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td nowrap>"not ((Pascal or Perl) and useful)
	      <td>Documents that do not contain both the words "useful"
	          and "Pascal" or the words "useful" and "Perl"
	    </tr>
	  </table>

	  Since InvertedIndexQuery is a separate module, implementing
	  an alternate query parser is a simple matter.
	   
      <dd><h3>Incremental Indexing</h3>
          Documents may be added to an existing index without the need
          to reindex the original data.  This allows indexing to be
	  split into smaller jobs that require less time.
    </dl>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <dl>
      <dd><h3>Index Object</h3>
          The Index object provides the basic functionality for indexing 
          and searching.  Indexing is done using the object's index()
          method.  The Index object behaves as a dictionary, mapping
          keywords to their corresponding search results, stopwords to
	  None, and stems and synonyms to their corresponding keywords.
	  Compiled regular expressions may be used as keys; the result of
          a search done with a regular expression is a series of searches
          performed on each matching keyword, their results joined by
          an "or" operation.

      <dd><h3>Pickle Dictionary</h3>
          Persistent indices make use of a "pickle dictionary", which
          is contained in the Index object.  The pickle dictionary
          intelligently manages saving and loading of index values, only
          pickling and unpickling individual index items as is necessary.
	  The pickle dictionary minimizes memory usage and load time
	  by using a specialized unpickling scheme[1].

      <dd><h3>Result List Object</h3>
          The ResultList object is the instance object returned as a result
          of a successful search.  It contains a list of pairs that consist 
          of the relevance ranking and id of each document returned by a
          search.  The ResultList objects behave as sequences returning a
          document pair corresponding to the index.  ResultList objects 
          support "and", "or", and "not" not operations as well as sorting 
          of their document pairs by relevance.  When an "and" operation
	  is performed on ResultList objects, corresponding relevance
	  rankings are added.  The following shows how composite relevance
	  rankings are calculated when the above operators are used.
	  <table>
	    <th>Operation<th>Method of Calculation
	    <tr>
	      <td> "or"
	      <td> sum of rankings
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td> "and"
	      <td> geometric mean of rankings
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td> "not"
	      <td> sum of rankings
	    </tr>
	  </table>
          <p>
	  ResultList objects can be passed into other search mechanisms to
	  allow for specialized searching, such as mixed full-text and
	  fielded searching.

    <h2>Sample Usage</h2>
    Below is example code which instantiates an Index object,indexes
    two files, and prints the result of a search on the index.
    
    <pre>
    import InvertedIndex
    import InvertedIndexQuery

    i = InvertedIndex.Index()

    filename = 'document1.txt'
    file_to_index = open(filename).read() 
    document_key = filename

    # index the document, using document_key as the document's
    # id.
    i.index(file_to_index, document_key)

    filename = 'document2.txt'
    file_to_index = open(filename).read()
    document_key = filename

    i.index(file_to_index, document_key)

    search_results = InvertedIndexQuery.query('Python and spam', i)
    search_results.sort()

    cnt = 0
    for document in search_results:
      cnt = cnt + 1
      print '%d) %s' % (cnt, document[1])
    
    </pre>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>

    InvertedIndex is freely-available. It has been tested on the
    following platforms:  Solaris 2.4 and Digital UNIX 3.2.<br>
    It is being used in Digital Creations' new Classified product.
    
    
    <h2>Future</h2>
    The next release of InvertedIndex will contain support for
    proximity searching, which is the ability to search for keywords
    "near" each other in the indexed document.  For instance,
    a search for the words "Python" and "rules" would return
    a document containing,<br>
	   <dl>
	     <dd><cite>Everybody knows that Python rules!</cite>
           </dl>
    but not a document containing,<br>
	   <dl>
	     <dd><cite>Python! Everybody knows that rules!</cite>
	   </dl>
