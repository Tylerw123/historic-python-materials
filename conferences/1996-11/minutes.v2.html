	<dd>In this progress report we describe our current approach
	to steering C++ computations with a Python shell. Our
	experiments have included combining Tk interfaces with
	scripting, Python on parallel processors, and using interface
	generators. The report will include a brief summary of the
	status of various Python extensions we are working on at LLNL.

      <DT><b>Notes:</b>
      <ul>
       <li>Shadowing C++ objects and interface generation presents alot of
               skel interfaces for for C++ classes.  However multiple dimentional 
                arrays are not skelled very well with SWIG
       <li> For the moment, we don't have a good solution
       <li> Need a tool, maybe a new version of MODULATOR to better write the 
               interface code to understand a bit more about the C++ data structures

	<dd>Python shows great promise as a research toolkit for
	scientists and engineers.  My talk will be about some work I
	know about which is part of an infrastructure for the
	development of tools used in various types of scientific
	research.

        <P>In the first part of the presentation, I will be reporting
        on the release of the OpenGL bindings for Python, work done in
        collaboration with Jim Hugunin, Mike Harsthorn and Tom
        Schwaller.

        <P>In the second part of the presentation, I will present some
        of the ways Python has been used at Brown in the fields of
        psycholinguistics, neural network modeling, and vision
        research.

	<dd>Many system administration tools make standard Unix system
	administration difficult.  After configuring a subsystem with
	a "helpful" tool, you may find that it is impossible to edit
	files by hand, or that after editing configuration files by
	hand, the "helpful" tools cannot be used.  By creating a set
	of Python classes to read, manipulate, and write system
	configuration files, the author has been able to create system
	administration tools which can co-exist with system
	administrators who sometimes hand-edit configuration files.

        <p>This will include a number of semi-generic classes for
        working with Linux configuration files.

                      corresponds, do you track and notify.
        <li> A: No not yet...  But I'd like to get towards that with some 'wizard' tools

       <DT><b>Abstract:</b>
	<dd>The Python object publisher (Bobo) allows objects to be
	published without any Common-Gateway Interface (CGI) or
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specific code.  Complex
	object hierarchies can be published with Uniform Resource
	Locators (URLs) that mimic the object hierachies.  Form data,
	including file upload data are marshalled into method
	parameters.  Most tasks associated with interaction between an
	application, such as URL traversal, parsing form data, parsing
	queries, parsing headers, parsing cookie data, access control,
	and error handling are performed automatically. This paper
	provides an overview of publishing python objects with the
	Bobo, with simple examples taken from an application written
	for the Python Software Activity (PSA).

      <ul>
          <li> Guido: I have a problem with Bobo's 'captive' use of doc strings.  It means 
                 you can't use docstrings for other purposes.
          <li> Jim: Well that's not the whole story, let's wait till later to discuss.
          <li> A nice feature: functions can raise exceptions corresponding to the HTTP
                  errors... so you could do a 'raise REDIRECT' or 'raise NOTFOUND' The
                  appropriate HTTP error code will be processed by the http server.
          <li> Has multi-level access control for objects.
           <li> Guido: Why not use something like IDL to specify interfaces
                   rather than relying on meta-information that's possibly implementation
                   specific and might change the next release?

       <DT><b>Abstract:</b>
	<dd>Many Web based applications must provide the capability
	for customers to be able to edit the look and feel of the
	application's Web pages.  Futhermore, our experience has been
	that mixing Python and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
	together makes both less readable.  We have developed a Python
	module, named DocumentTemplate that allows documents to be
	created with embedded markup that causes data from Python
	objects to be inserted into documents when they are output
	from an application.  The data insertion goes beyond simple
	insertion of data with C-language formats to include:</p>

      <p>Two source formats are supported: extended Python format
       strings, and HTML with markup that uses server-side-include
       syntax.  When document templates are attributes of objects
       published with the Python Object Publisher (Bobo), then Bobo
       treats the templates as as methods and binds then to their
       associated objects when they are called to output text; the
       document template source may then refer to object attributes.
       HTML document templates provide a web interface that supports
       through-the-web editing and management of document source.This
       paper will provide an overview of Document Templates with
       simple examples of HTML methods taken from an application
       written for the Python Software Activity (PSA).  Providing

       <DT><b>Abstract:</b>
	<dd>As applications evolve beyond simple document retrieval, the
       need arizes for efficient management of persistent information
       that can be managed through the World-Wide-Web (Web) by
       customers and end users.  We have developed a collection of
       modules that support management of persistent objects on the
       Web.  The modules build on the Python pickle mechanism and
       provide support for:
       </p>
     <ul><li><p>On-demand object activation,</p>
         <li><p>Delay of loading object data until needed, to speed
            activation,</p>
         <li><p>Support for persistent sub-objects that are retrieved and
            updated independently from containing objects,</p>
         <li><p>Management of multiple object versions and loging of
            object changes,</p>
         <li><p>Simple transaction management that rolls back object
            updates when errors occur.</p>
      </ul>

      <p>The modules currently use a very simple data format.  All
      data changes are made by appending new revisions to the end of
      the file, reducing opportunities for file corruption.</p>

      <p>This paper will provide an overview of the persistence
      modules and their interaction with the Python Object Publisher
      (Bobo), with a simple example taken from an application written
      for the Python Software Activity (PSA).  The paper also presents
      limitations and issues arising from the use of the Python pickle
      mechanism and steps taken or planned to address them.</p>

       text-search engines provide many capabilities but often have
       large overhead in process size, application complexity, and
       licensing cost.  We have developed a simple Python module,
       InvertedIndex, that has a simple python application programming
       interface and that provides support for incremental indexing,
       and for stop-word, synonym, and stemming databases.  This paper

       <DT><b>Abstract:</b>
	<dd>The Grammar-based Rapid Application Development (GRAD)
	system is an interface generator between Python and legacy
	languages. To allow the interface generator to work with
	multiple languages, the interface is based upon a grammar for
	a given language. Currently, the C++ language has had its
	interface compiler created and successfully emits the
	necessary binding code to make C++ code accessible from
	Python.

        <P>The GRAD process is non-intrusive so the legacy code does
        not have to be modified in order for the interface to work. No
        superclasses or include files are added to the existing
        code. Therefore, the legacy code is not directly dependent on
        the interface and changes in the interface generator system do
        not require changes in the legacy code. Changes to the legacy
        code naturally requires the regeneration of the interface but
        no manual editing of the generated interface is needed, so the
        interface generation can be made part of the make process.

	<P>Using GRAD, the promise of entire new applications written
	rapidly in the high level language Python is attainable while
	still preserving much of the operational advantage of, and
	investment in, existing compiled and tested code.

       <DT><b>Abstract:</b>
	<dd>Python, being freeware, can meet resistance when it comes
	to it's use on production government systems. The first step,
	in many cases, is to dispel myths management might harbor
	about the risks of using Unix freeware. With a judicious set
	of technology insertion criteria, management can determine if
	a given piece of software belongs in their production tool box
	or not. Having a process for this decision-making can help
	prevent good technologies from being rejected based on gut
	feel only. Python is an excellent example of quality software
	available on the internet that can be put to use with great
	effect to solve problems many organizations face.

	<dd>The GIST Graphics extension has now been improved to
	include 3-D plots.  Interestingly, the 3-D part has been done
	using just the 2-D part of the GIST library; Python, using the
	Numeric extension, does the extensive calculations needed for
	the 3-D plots. In this talk we show what the package can
	do. GIST is a freely-available graphics package written by
	David Munro.

	<dd>At LLNL we are using Python as the
                                             script language to a new code for computational
                                             fusion simulation. This presentation will discuss
                                             ways in which Python is being employed in this
                                             effort.

            <li> How to hook up Python to C++
            <li> ...by making C++ classes available to Python
            <li> Also desire a visual oriented representation (Tk)
            <li> Inspecting the inside or compiled C++ code does
         not let you see the big picture.
            <li> Need an application specific debugger
            <li> Would like enough C++ glue in Python so that an
         C++ extension writer can inherit the Python interfaces
         ... or something like that.
            <li> Python C programming interface is not well suited for
         use in C++
            <li> Python/Tk reates geometry manager though inheritence, should
         be global.  tkinter brings along packer placer, grid though 
         inheritence.  This should be global data not a property of
         the widget
            <li> Python/Tk lacks a coherent mega-widget model (10 component widgets
         in the small example in the slides.  Look like they should be
         one thing.  If I set the background to red, nothing happens, because
         it's occluded.  What should happen, is all the widgets should
         inherit the new background color.
            <li> One posible solution is using 'incrTk' (sp?) that extends tk to
         be more heirachical.  
            <li> Guido: We should be able to do this from tkinter.

       <DT><b>Abstract:</b>

	<dd>If you believe the industry hype, within a year, Sun
	Microsystems Java will not only be the language of choice for
	programming the World Wide Web, but also the first tool
	developers reach for in other more general-purpose programming
	areas dominated today by C and C++.  Being derived from C++,
	with the addition of garbage collection and the removal of
	pointers, Java has many features to make developing and
	debugging programs easier. Its not difficult to imagine hordes
	of C++ programmers, tired of their languages idiosyncrasies
	and bulk, moving to Java, just as they moved from C++ from C,
	when they discovered the benefits of object orientation.

        <P>Python is an elegant, general-purpose, object-oriented
        scripting language that is freely available for anyone to use
        for any purpose.  Being interpreted, Python has no need for a
        compiler and much less need for a formal development
        environment.  Python is a concise very-high-level language.  A
        typical program requires less then half the amount of source
        code than any of the C derived languages, including Java.
        Python offers programmers conciseness, simplicity, and the
        short test cycle benefits of an interpretive environment.
        These features combine to enable rapid prototyping with more
        building and less writing.

        <P>No one language should be all things to all software
        engineers.  As possible next-generation languages, both Java
        and Python bring many new capabilities to developers that
        increase productivity.  In contrast, each has aspects that are
        relatively weak when compared with other languages.  This
        paper explores some of the merits and drawbacks of each
        language, for a number of different application areas, with
        the intent of proving each to be a worthy addition to the pool
        of valuable software engineering tools.

	<dd> This talk follows the same format as the previous
          workshops.  Guido summarizes changes since the last
          workshop and discussion of what is to be done in the next
          release.  It's also a question and answer period and a
          chance to discuss topics not covered earlier in the workshop.
      <DT><b>Notes:</b>
    <ul>
    <li> General tkinter improvments
    <li> tk C things are not all available to the Python programmer
    <li> No desire to touch Tk sources
    <li> Proposal: a tk renaming, and adding tix (has a mega-widget notion)
    <li> Having support for Python meta-widgets in Tk would be worthwhile
         without using tix
    <li> A problem with tkinter is it does not have any way of producing
         shadow python code for widgets it does not create... i.e. from tix
    <li> Proposal: a python/tk editing environment that has a python-mode
         and an execute button...  sort of what Mark Hammond does for
         Windows pythonwin
    <li> This environment could be extended to have a debugger
    <li> 'Frameworks' are good!
    <li> Proposal: I think it's time to rewrite the regex module 
    <li> Proposal: let's start a text sig... to discuss the issues
    <li> Pickle rewritten in C.  Jim Fulton: we're working on it.
    <li> Jim F: The first pass was not as fast as we hoped.
    <li> 7% speed up with rewrite of persistent-ID's in C
    <li> Dreams:
    <ul>
        <li> standard interface for C++
        <li> compilation to C
        <li> More documentation and docstrings everywhere
    </ul>
    <li> stack mobility and the grand renaming has been committed to at CNRI
    <li> inheritence from C types
    <li> meta-class extensions (MESS, Extention classes)
    <li> numeric core perminant part of the core distribution?
    <li> Jim F: I think we should spend more time on the C API
         (since Jim H. had to modify it for his numeric stuff)
    <li> When you try to involk the interpreter from a thread, it gets messy
    <li> Greg Stein is working on a modified interpreter that works
    <ul>
         <li> moved alot of internal state to a datastructure...  and keeps
              one copy for each thread.
         <li> He hasn't done a thread save dictionaries and lists
         <li> A mutex will have to be created for each... making perf 
              a possible issue
    </ul>
    <li> Name mangling...  More people don't want it than want it.
    <li> Keyword 'private'?

         what is possible.  I think there is room for many object 
         models in Python.
    <li> Guido: if more than one of these extension class mechanisms 
         becomes used, there are slight semantic differences that are
         introduced into the handling the classes.  Big tradeoff.
    <li> First super-class in the list of base-classes must be of 
         the extended type class
    <li> Jim: I would rather overload the class statement than
         switch on the first class argument.
    <li> Only one base extention class can define any data in C.
    <li> Rules for mixed-type arithmetic are different for Python
         class instances than they are for extension class instances.
