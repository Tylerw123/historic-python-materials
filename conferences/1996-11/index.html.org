   <TD>
	This workshop will differ from the full Python Confernence
format.  The goal is to have an in depth discussion on a few
specific topics. The topics have been selected to complement the
subject of the host conference as well as to meet short term
objectives of the PSA.  A full Conference is being planned for
sometime in 1997.  There are four sessions for this workshop: 

	<UL>
	  <LI>A session for meeting with Guido to discuss the next
phase of Python's development.  (Planning for Python 2.0)
	<HR>
	  <LI>Status reports and planning session on the use of Python
by Government agencies.  This is not intended to be restricted to just
participants from U.S. governemnts.  The session is open for
paper submissions from any organization that works with any government
agency.  
	<HR>
	  <LI>A status report and a planning session for the
development of scientific and engineering extensions to Python.
	<HR>
	  <LI>A review of experiences with using Python for Unix
system administration.  The session will try to answer the question:
Can a layer of Python based GUI interfaces to Unix system
administration tools make Unix competative with Windows NT in the eyes
of a non-geek end user?
