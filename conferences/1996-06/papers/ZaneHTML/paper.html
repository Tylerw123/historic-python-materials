<H1>Narcisse</H1> 
<P>
Narcisse is a graphics package developed by our French colleagues at Centre
d'Etudes de Limeil-Valenton of the Commissariat d'Energie Atomique. Narcisse is
quite comprehensive; it can do two-, three-, and four-dimensional plots (the
latter meaning that the surface is colored according to the values of an
arbitrary function). One can open and send plots to a Narcisse window on a
distant machine (handy if you want to show the boss a nice plot but you don't
want to run over to her building with a hard copy).</P>
<P>
  Narcisse has a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) which, once a
graph has appeared, allows the user to change its characteristics interactively.
This enables one to find the best appearance for a particular plot without
having to graph it repeatedly from the user program. Previously created files in
various formats can also be imported directly into the Narcisse GUI and
manipulated from there. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many graphics systems, whose functions are actually linked into one's
program, Narcisse runs independently, as a graphics server. The user program
communicates with Narcisse via Unix sockets. This communication is quite low
level and very complex. The appearance of a plot is controlled by nearly 150
parameters for determining such things as the color palette, type of shading,
axis scales, curve and surface labels, titles, angle and distance of view (for
three- and four-dimensional graphs), hidden line removal, etc. Most end users do
not wish to spend time learning the tedious details of such interfaces; they
would just like to specify data and ask to have it plotted.</P>
<P>
  This paper describes a high level, easy to use graphics interface which hides
(as much as possible) the low level details of whatever graphics system is
actually being used, so that the low level can be essentially ``plug-and-play.''
Then, whenever a better system becomes available, it should only be necessary to
change low level interface routines not normally accessed by ordinary users.
Python, with its easy extendability, was ideally suited for this job.</P>

<P><A NAME="Curve">
</A></P>
<H1>Curve, Surface, and Mesh objects</H1> 
<P>Curve, Surface, and Mesh are three Python classes which abstract the
geometric properties of the objects which we wish to graph. Each instantiation
of one of these objects will contain the geometric specification of a single
curve, surface, or mesh  respectively (coordinates, and physical data in the
case of Surfaces and Meshes), as well as information about appearance (color,
graph type, plotting options, etc.). Each of these classes has two member
functions: set, which allows one or more of its characteristics to be changed;
and new, which reinitializes the object.
</P> 
<P>A Surface is essentially a two-dimensional object viewed in
three-dimensional space, while a Mesh is really a three-dimensional object.
However, plotted with hidden lines removed, a closed surface and a solid
realized as a mesh whose boundary is that surface may look exactly the same, and
indeed, share many characteristics. The difference is that with a Surface, we
are only interested in the outside, whereas with a Mesh, we may be interested in
stripping away outside layers to see what is going on inside. In this way a Mesh
can be considered a specialization of a Surface, and so in this implementation
Mesh is a derived class of Surface.
</P> 
<HR>
<P><A NAME="Graphics">
</A></P>
<H1>Graph objects: Graph2d and Graph3d</H1>
<P>The context in which a graph of a geometric object actually appears has been
abstracted into a base class called Graph; its derived classes Graph2d and
Graph3d contain information peculiar to two and three dimensional plots,
respectively. Graphs know about such things as axes (whether they appear, what
they look like, their scales, etc.), titles and other text which may appear on
the graph, and (for three dimensional plots) the angle and distance of the view
point. A Graph is aware that a graphics engine is out there and knows how to
interface with it via a class instance of a Plotter (see the next section for
more details on Plotters).
</P>
<P>The interface to a Plotter is generic; it is only at the Plotter level of
this interface, and the lower C interface level, that actual details of the
graphics engine are known. A Graph can be asked to plot itself. If at this point
the application program has not somehow been informed of the existence of a
Plotter to use to plot itself, then it creates a generic Plotter which somehow
connects to a graphics engine. In the case of Narcisse, a connection can easily
be made if Narcisse is running on the same platform. The Plotter is able to
communicate with this Narcisse via a socket, whose number it obtains from an
environment variable PORT_SERVEUR. If Narcisse is running on a remote platform,
the connection can be made if the DISPLAY variable is set for that platform and
the environment variable DEST_SP3 is set to a string which encodes the platform
name, Narcisse&#185;s socket number there, and the userid. Other graphics
engines will work differently, but could still be fired up by the same generic
call at the Graph level.
</P>
<P>The application program (or the user at the command line) can also specify
one or more connections to graphics. This can be done by passing encoded strings
(called &#179;filenames&#178;) or identifiers of open Plotters to the Graph
object. In the case of Narcisse, a &#179;filename&#178; is encoded as described
above; with other graphics engines, it might be a real filename, or a
differently encoded set of directions to a remote graphics process. Since a
Graph may be aware of more than one Plotter, it is capable of plotting itself &#179;simultaneously&#178;
on more than one platform.
</P>
<P>One of the design decisions was exactly how to apportion the 150-some
Narcisse parameters among geometric objects and the Graph objects. Generally I
tried to keep all information intrinsic to a geometric abstraction (coordinates,
color, appearance) with the geometric objects, and extrinsic information about
the context of the plot (presence or absence of axes, point of view, size,
particular Narcisse connection, etc.) within Graph objects. Such a clean
division was not always possible. For example, two dimensional plots in Narcisse
can have their colors chosen from exactly one palette. However, three and four
dimensional objects can be linked in such a way that each can have a separate
palette. Thus in the former case, a palette could be considered a Graph
characteristic, while in the latter, it can be treated as a characteristic of an
individual Surface. 
</P>

<P><A NAME="Plotter">
</A></P>
<H1>Nar.py: the Plotter class</H1>  
<P>Nar.py, which embodies the definition of the Plotter class, is the low-level
Python interface with the graphics engine, and as such is therefore acquainted
with the graphics details. In our case a Plotter instantiation is aware of a
connection to Narcisse, which is either handed to it by a Graph object or is
created by default when it is instantiated. A Plotter has numerous somewhat
higher level member functions which communicate with the lower level ones in the
graphics interface. A Plotter object has two functionalities, namely:</P> 
<UL><LI>It operates as a conduit through which Graphs can pass their geometric
and graphical characteristics (color, label,...).</LI>
<LI>It conveys information about aspects of the plot which are independent of
the geometric abstractions being plotted, such as axis scales and limits, graph
titles, existence or lack of a coordinate grid, etc., and for three dimensional
plots, the angles and distance of the view point, etc.</LI>
</UL> 
<P>
  The settings of the most common of the low level Narcisse parameters are
controlled by functions with self-explanatory names, such as set_3d_grid_type,
set_3d_options, set_axis_labels, set_curve_color, set_mask, and even
set_language (the GUI can appear either in French or in English). Since most
graphics packages offer similar functionality, I hope that these names are
sufficiently generic to be usable regardless of the underlying graphics. Curve
plotting and surface plotting are each controlled by a single function
(plot_curve and plot_surface, respectively). This is possible because of the
ability of Python to determine the number of arguments with which a function is
called, and their types, sizes, and shapes. With this information, a Plotter can
decide which of the several Narcisse functions is the appropriate one to call.
Again, I hope that this will carry over to Plotter-type interfaces with other
graphics packages.</P>

<P><A NAME="nmodule">
</A></P>
<H1>narcissemodule</H1> 
<P>This module, written in C and callable (of course) from Python, is really a
low-level set of wrappers for the functions in Narcisse. It accepts Python
argument lists, parses them (if possible) into data acceptable to Narcisse, and
passes it on. There is a local data structure for storing up Narcisse keywords
and their values (which are used mainly to control the appearance of the graph)
until they are to be shipped to Narcisse. Normally a whole series of keywords
will be specified and then accumulated to configure a graph, but not sent to
Narcisse until it is actually ready to do a plot. (If keywords were sent to
Narcisse as they were defined, then whatever data that had been last sent would
be replotted using the new values, which is usually not the desired outcome.)
Finally, there is a local translation table: since Narcisse recognizes only
French keywords, we have supplied a table of English equivalents to make things
easier for the low-level user (mainly us, to be sure).</P> 
<P>
Thus there are very few surprises in this module. It contains routines to open
and close a connection to Narcisse, to query whether one exists, and to
synchronize. There are routines to add keyword values to the local table, and
one to send the final list to Narcisse. Two dimensional routines can plot one or
several curves simultaneously. The curves can be colored and labeled, and drawn
in various ways (continuously, as step functions, or just as points marked by
various symbols).</P>
<P>
  Surface plotting routines are where Narcisse excels. It supports both three
dimensional plots, where the surface is colored according to the value of the z
coordinate, and four-dimensional plots, where the coloring is determined by a
function defined at each of the plotted points. There are various coloring
options, including wire grid, flat or face coloring, contour lines, and contour
shading. The surface can be transparent, or there are three masking options of
increasing complexity to remove hidden portions from the graph.</P>
<P>
  Finally, there are routines for doing three dimensional solids which have been
decomposed into cells by means of both structured and nonstructured grids. These
plots can be most enlightening when a portion of the surface is removed so that
one can see the interior cells.</P>
