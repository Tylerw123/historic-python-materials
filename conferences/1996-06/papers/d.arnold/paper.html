    <b>Abstract</b>

    <p align=center>

    <i>
      Hector is a distributed object system written primarily in
      Python.  It provides a communications transparency layer
      enabling negotiation of communication protocol qualities,
      comprehensive support services for application objects and a
      novel interaction architecture.
    </i>

    <p align=center>

    <i>
      We discuss the implementation, the services and the interaction
      architecture; we also comment on the effectiveness of Python as
      the implementation language for the project.  We conclude with
      an outline of the current status and future plans for the
      project.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    Object oriented design and programming has become a broadly
    accepted approach to computing.  It is particularly beneficial in
    distributed environments where the encapsulation and subsequent
    independence of objects allows distribution of an application.
    However, programming distributed object systems is difficult,
    complicated by the possibilities of hetergeneous machine
    architectures, physically distant locations and independent
    component failures.

    <p>

    A number of distributed processing environments have been
    developed that attempt to hide these problems from programmers,
    reducing the complexity of their task.  Prominent amongst these
    are APM's ANSAware <a href = "#ansa">[1]</a>, the OSF's DCE <a
    href = "#dce">[2]</a>, the OMG's CORBA <a href = "#corba">[3]</a>
    and Microsoft's COM <a href = "#com">[4]</a>.  In addition, the
    ISO and ITU-T have invested significant effort in an international
    standard known as the Reference Model for Open Distributed
    Processing (RM-ODP) <a href = "#rm-odp">[5]</a> addressing
    problems in this area of work.

    <p>

    ANSAware is an early, and influential, implementation of some
    concepts from RM-ODP.  Although now largely obselete, it provides
    facilities only now being matched by the more recently popular
    environments.  These included federated Traders, rudimentry Type
    Management, and a notification service.

    <p>

    The OSF's Distributed Computing Environment provides a series of
    services for distributed programming, but does not support an
    explicitly object-oriented programming model.  This has limited
    its acceptance, despite its sometimes superior design and
    implementation.

    <p>

    The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a
    specification from the OMG now being broadly adopted across the
    industry, and despite its immaturity in some areas, its adoption
    of a fully object oriented architecture seems set to ensure its
    dominance over DCE.

    <p>

    Finally, Microsoft's Common Object Model is proposed as a
    distributed extension of their existing Object Linking and
    Embedding (now ActiveX) technology.  At this point COM is more
    specification than implementation but it is destined to become a
    significant influence.

    <p>

    Unfortunately, none of these systems implement all the features
    described by RM-ODP, and in particular, each is basically a closed
    environment, allowing interoperation only with other objects from
    the same environment.

    <p>

    After examination of these environments and with particular
    reference to RM-ODP, we set about implementation of a distributed
    environment which overcomes their limitations.

    <p>

    The result is <i>Hector</i>, a framework which sits above other
    distributed environments, providing open negotiation and
    interoperability of communication protocols, high level
    description of component services and their requirements, a rich
    set of support services for objects and an interaction framework
    which allows the description of workflow-like interactions between
    autonomous objects.

    <p>

    The prototype is implemented almost entirely in Python, taking
    advantage of the language's wide support for other services and
    powerful syntax, enabling rapid development.


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>The Hector Environment</h2>


    Programming of distributed systems using traditional tools is
    complex and error prone.  In an effort to reduce this difficulty,
    a range of <i>transparencies</i> are normally introduced.
    Transparencies hide a component of the complexity and allow the
    programmer to manipulate the abstraction that they implement.

    <p>

    RM-ODP defines a number of transparencies described in some detail
    by Linnington <a href="#linnington">[6]</a>.  An important
    attribute of transparencies in RM-ODP are that they are removable
    - a programmer can elect to manipulate the underlying
    functionality directly if desired.

    <p>

    Hector attempts to provide application objects with a consistent
    environment, regardless of their physical location, through a
    series of transparencies.  Designed with the goal of supporting a
    dynamic, global system of distributed objects, it embraces
    diversity through extensibility.  Specifically, we support

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>multiple parties in high level interaction bindings,
      <li>multiple object implementation languages,
      <li>multiple interaction models, and,
      <li>multiple transport protocols
    </ul>

    while maintaining transparent usage of object services.

    <p>


    <h3>Binding</h3>

    Communication between distributed objects is traditionally modelled
    as remote method invocation.  This has two flavours, RPC and
    messaging, depending upon whether the method has a return value.
    The methods that a remote object exports are collectively called
    its interface.  Typically, having selected a remote object,
    normally identified by some opaque address type, the programmer
    can invoke a method at the remote interface.

    <p>

    RM-ODP, and subsequently Hector, extend this notion with the
    formal concept of <i>bindings</i>.  A binding is a specification
    of a set of roles, and the communication patterns between those
    roles needed to perform some higher level function.

    <p>

    This allows complex, enterprise-level tasks to be described as
    binding types, similar in some ways to work-flow descriptions.

    <p>

    Hector provides an abstract Binding class which is specialised by
    application programmers.  The kernel can then instantiate these
    derived classes.  The instantiation process establishes the
    communication channels described by the binding type.

    <p>

    For example, the requirements of a distributed meeting scheduler
    can be specified at programming time as a binding type
    encompassing individuals' calendars, room and equipment
    reservation services, notification to a news service and the
    scheduler component itself.  The construction of the required
    peer-to-peer communication channels at runtime is left to the
    infrastructure rather than being explicitly programmed.

    
    <h3>Services</h3>

    Objects require services, and in a distributed environment, some
    services must be available via the network rather than relying on
    those provide by the local machine.  Some of those services can be
    deemed fundamental, for reasons of bootstrapping, dependency or as
    a means of ensuring a richer programming environment.

    <p>

    Hector guarantees to provide a fixed set of fundamental services
    at every location.  The actual implementation of the services can
    vary, but the service interface provided to objects is
    standardised and guaranteed to be available.

    <p>

    We have selected nine fundamental services, with a particular
    emphasis on providing a rich environment for objects.  These
    services are:

    <dl>
      <dt>Notification
      <dd>Generation of event information and subscription to
          receive notification of events using expressions over the
          event information.

          <p>

          We are using the Elvin <a href="#elvin">[7]</a> notification
          service, being developed as a parallel activity at the DSTC.

          <p>

      <dt>Authentication
      <dd>Authentication of object identity.  These credentials are
          used for authorisation checks during binding.

          <p>

      <dt>Privacy
      <dd>Communication between Objects and storage of information can
          both require privacy.  The Privacy service provides a
          mechanism for encrypting data.

          <p>

          One of our major areas of work is the interoperation of
          security services, including means of authentication,
          authorisation and protection of privacy.

          <p>

      <dt>Banking
      <dd>Objects need to pay for use of services.  In order to
          maintain their "credit" across invocations, a banking
          service is provided.  Objects may open accounts and access
          them using identifying tokens.

          <p>

      <dt>Naming
      <dd>The name service provides a mechanism to associate
          information with a string name.  This interface is modelled
          on the X/Open Federated Naming specification <a href =
          "#xfn">[8]</a>, but modified to support an object oriented
          interface <a href="#chilvers">[9]</a>.

          <p>

      <dt>Type Management
      <dd>A repository of type descriptions.  A single type may have
          descriptions in many languages, from English commentary,
          through formal specifications, to executable specifications.

          <p>

      <dt>Trading
      <dd>When an Object requires the use of a service, it can locate
          instances of that service type in many ways.  The Trading
          service provides a content-based or "Yellow Pages" style
          query, parameterised by service type and quality attributes.

          <p>

          Service providers advertise their service, describing their
          attributes.  Service consumers query the Trader which
          returns a list of possible providers.

          <p>

          The Trading service interface is modelled on the proposed
          joint ISO ODP / OMG CORBA Trader specification <a href =
          "#trader">[10]</a>.

          <p>

      <dt>Policy
      <dd>Objects require configuration information.  In a distributed
          system, traditional methods such as a configuration file,
          environment variables or the X Window System resources are
          not available.  The Hector Policy service provides a
          mechanism for retrieving an arbitrary string of information
          using a wild card key, similar to X resources.

         <p>

         The resolution of this key is dependent upon a configurable
         hierarchy of policy contexts.  If no match is found within
         the initial context, resolution proceeds up a chain of nested
         contexts.

         <p>

         The specification of the context ordering is configurable on
         a host, network or enterprise basis.

         <p>

      <dt>Relationships
      <dd>Objects frequently need to maintain records of their
          relationships with other Objects.  This service provides a
          strongly typed repository of relationship instances, which
          can be queried by Objects to retrieve that information.
 
         <p>

    </dl>

    Service implementations are bound to the standard interfaces
    during the initialisation of the environment, as determined by a
    local configuration file.  This file can be set on a per host, per
    network or other basis.  An example of this configuration is to select
    an existing enterprise name service for use in Hector, such as the
    DCE CDS/GDS or the Solaris NIS+ system.


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>The Hector Architecture</h2>


    Hector is structured as four layered components representing
    decreasing levels of abstraction.  These layers are the Object,
    Language, Encapsulation (or Kernel) and Communication layers as
    shown in the following diagram.

    <p align=center>

    <img src = "de-design.fig_13.gif" alt="Layering diagram">

    <p>

    During execution, the three lower layers combine to form a single
    entity called the <i>Capsule</i>, which provides a support
    environment for Object execution.  It encapsulates and insulates
    Objects from the underlying machine and operating system
    architectures.

    <p>

    The Capsule is an executable program, normally started by
    privileged users.  Multiple Objects can exist within a Capsule,
    each being allocated an initial thread (which may spawn more).
    Each Object is associated with a security principal which controls
    its access to the resources of the Capsule and its host.  Multiple
    Capsules can be run on a single host; the choice of whether to
    instantiate an Object within an existing Capsule or to create a
    new one is a matter of performance tuning.

    <p align = center>

    <img src=de-design.fig_8.gif alt = "Capsules and Objects Diagram">

    <p>

    Components of the language and communication layers can be
    dynamically loaded at runtime.  Specific communication and
    language modules are typically configured when starting a Capsule,
    but they can be added or removed by the Capsule's owner at any
    time.

    <p>

    During execution, each layer is comprised of instances from a
    number of classes.  These are discussed in more detail in the
    following sections.


    <h4>Object Layer</h4>

    The Object layer contains both application programs (Objects) and
    services loaded by the Capsule during its initialisation.  Objects
    execute as separate entities within the Capsule process, each with
    at least one private thread.

    <p>

    The interface between the Object and Language layer represents the
    complete set of facilities available to an Object. (While it is
    currently possible for an Object to directly access operating
    system functions, this ability will be removed in a future version
    once replacement services are available and suitable security
    services are implemented.  The Service class, derived from Object,
    will retain its access to the host's facilities and can be used to
    make them available to other Objects.)

    <p>

    Objects are created from <i>Templates</i> - a description of an
    Object type which can be interpreted by the appropriate language
    layer to create instances.  Objects are instantiated by the
    Capsule as a result of operations on the Capsule management
    interface.


    <h4>Language Layer</h4>

    The Hector kernel is designed to support Objects written in
    different languages.  A module that implements the mapping between
    the Capsule Kernel layer (written in Python) and Objects written
    in a particular language is called a <i>language binding</i>.  The
    set of language bindings loaded into a Capsule forms the
    <i>language layer.</i><p>

    Each language binding performs three basic functions, the first of
    which is mandatory.

    <ul>
      <li>Encapsulate the kernel layer classes making them
          accessible from the Object language.
      <li>Enable instantiation of Objects using language specific
          Templates.
      <li>Enable execution of the instantiated Objects.
    </ul>

    <b>Wrapper Classes</b>

    <p>

    Each language binding consists of a set of classes encapsulating
    the facilities provided by the Capsule Kernel and the fundamental
    services.  These classes are 

    <dl>

      <dt><i>Message</i>
      <dd>Message types are used or specialised by the Object
          programmer to describe the basic message units needed for
          communication between the application objects.

          <p>

          The base Message class of a language binding must also map
          the native language data types onto those supported by the
          kernel.  This issue has already been addressed (to different
          extents) by DCE, CORBA and ILU - we intend to borrow heavily
          from their work in this area.

          <p>

      <dt><i>Interaction</i>
      <dd>Interaction types constrain patterns of Message exchange
          between Interfaces.  Standard Interactions including RPC,
          streams and multicast are predefined classes, while other
          complex Message patterns can be specified by programmers.

         <p>

      <dt><i>Interface</i>
      <dd>Interface types used or specialised by the Object programmer
          to constrain the messages received and sent by an Object.

          <p>

          Hector Interfaces must explicitly describe all communication
          external to the Object.  Interfaces use Message types to
          specify the content of communicated data, while the
          ordering, permitted concurrency and other qualities of
          service related to the communication are directly constrained
          by Interface types.

          <p>

      <dt><i>Role</i>
      <dd>Role is a subtype of Interface used in the specification of
          Interactions and Bindings.  It describes the required
          characteristics of Interfaces capable of fulfilling the
          nominated role in the Interaction or Binding.

          <p>

          During instantiation of Bindings, Interface instances are
          required to satisfy the Role types.

          <p>

      <dt><i>Binding</i>
      <dd>Expressed in terms of Messages, Interactions and Interfaces,
          Bindings constrain the connections between the Objects used
          by an application.

          <p>

          The use of Message, Interface and Binding types allows a
          programmer to ensure the robustness of an Object while
          allowing dynamic use of different service implementations
          and communication protocols.  The kernel ensures that the
          abstract communication specified by the Binding occurs
          correctly or generates exceptions.

          <p>

      <dt><i>Object</i>
      <dd>The base Object class is specialised by the programmer to
          create Hector application components.  Several subclasses of
          Object provide different levels of abstraction suited for
          different Object types.

          <p>

      <dt><i>Offer</i>
      <dd>Objects interact by offering and consuming services.
          Objects wishing to offer a service create an instance of the
          Offer class, specifying the Interface type and their
          qualities of service.  The Offer instance is created within
          the kernel and manages requests from other Objects for the
          use of the Object.

          <p>

      <dt><i>Capsule</i>
      <dd>The Capsule class defines the interface to the only
          external functionality available to Objects.  It includes
          construction methods for the preceding classes and access to
          the instances of the service classes defined below.

          <p>

      <dt><i>NameService</i>
      <dt><i>NotificationService</i>
      <dt><i>TraderService</i>
      <dt><i>TypeService</i>
      <dt><i>PolicyService</i>
      <dt><i>AuthenticationService</i>
      <dt><i>PrivacyService</i>
      <dt><i>BankService</i>
      <dt><i>RelationshipService</i>
      <dd>The fundamental services provided by the Capsule are
          represented as classes with standard APIs.  The Service
          classes are an abstraction which hide details of the real
          services provided by a specific host/site.

          <p>

          Each Capsule makes an instance of these classes available to
          its Objects.  Services themselves are a specialised subclass
          of Object implemented with careful negotiation of their
          mutual dependencies.

          <p>

    </dl>

    Each of these classes must be implemented in the target language.
    The target class methods are bound to the Hector system C API -
    implemented as a Python C module.  The classes must wrap the
    Python kernel classes and propagate call-backs from within Hector
    back to the bound language.

    <p>


    <b>Template Languages</b><p>

    Language bindings can provide support for additional Template
    formats if required.  A Template is a description of a type with
    enough detail to allow its instantiation.

    <p>

    The Python language binding provides two Template formats:
    <tt>.py</tt> and <tt>.pyc</tt>-style strings.  Some initial work
    has also been done on implementing a Unix shared object file
    template format, with the intention that it be used for compiled
    languages.  Additional compiled languages are unlikely to require
    a new template language since they can share the mechanism for
    loading shared object file templates.

    <p>

    However, most interpreted languages have one or more executable
    formats.  Typically the raw source or a pre-parsed/checked
    byte-code are acceptable to the interpreter.  Both of these formats
    can be used as a template language.

    <p>

    <b>Interpreters</b><p>

    Finally, Template languages other than OS/processor-specific
    machine code will require that Capsules load an interpreter
    module.  This will normally require the interpreter to be
    available as a dynamically loadable module able to be called by
    the Capsule.<p>

    Languages (such as Smalltalk) which are dependent on a large
    runtime system or are difficult to call from C are likely to be
    problematic.  This is an area of ongoing work.

    <p>

    <b>Python Language Binding</b><p>

    The initial language layer supports Python.  It is available by
    default, since the visible kernel classes are actually written in
    Python, making the wrapper classes very simple.

    <p>

    For Python, Object Templates consist of either Python source code
    or the tokenised source used in <tt>.pyc</tt> files.  The Python
    language layer uses a modified version of <tt>import</tt> to fetch
    imported modules from the Type service, before attempting to
    locate them locally.  This allows host machines to provide only
    the basic Python installation with all other modules served from a
    LAN-based distribution service.

    <p>

    <h4>Kernel Layer</h4>

    The kernel layer lies below the language layer and uses the
    communications layer for interaction.  It provides implementations
    of the major Hector classes

    <ul>
      <li>Message
      <li>Interface
      <li>Role
      <li>Interaction
      <li>Binding
      <li>Offer
      <li>Object
      <li>Service
      <li>Capsule
    </ul>

    The function of these classes has been described previously.  They
    are implemented in Python within the kernel, utilising the
    underlying communication layer.

    <p>


    <h4>Communications Layer</h4>

    The communication layer addresses transport protocol transparency.
    The kernel is able to interact through multiple protocols while
    knowing nothing about the implementation of the transport
    protocol.  Classes provided by the abstract communication layer
    include:

    <dl>
      <dt><i>Protocol</i>
      <dd>Protocol is an abstraction for an entity able to create
          Endpoint instances.  It describes the kind of endpoints it
          can create using the abstract Message, Interface and
          Interaction classes.  This permits constraints on the data
          types of messages, their sequencing at the endpoint (for
          example, RPCs announcements or streams) and their ability to
          connect to other parties (for example, peer to peer or
          multicast).
      
          <p>

      <dt><i>Endpoint</i>
      <dd>Endpoint instances maintain an actual communication protocol
          endpoint within an abstract interface.

          <p>

          Interface instances are implemented by one or more Endpoint
          instances, depending on their required connectivity to other
          Objects.  The actual mapping of an Interface to a set of
          Endpoints is performed by the Binding constructor using the
          initiating Object's policy setting to choose a preferred
          communication protocol for each physical connection.

          <p>

      <dt><i>Address</i>
      <dd>Endpoint addresses are opaquely encoded in Address
          instances.  Each Protocol supports one or more Address
          formats which it registers with the Capsule to allow
          resolution of Interface Endpoints.

    The communication layer is comprised of the set of Protocol
    instances existing in a Capsule.  Protocols can be dynamically
    loaded and unloaded using the Capsule's management interface.

    <p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>Tools</h2>

    The Hector environment provides several tools for programmers and
    users in addition to the basic Capsule executable, the Services
    and the Object classes.

    <p>

    Description of Bindings and Interfaces has traditionally been
    performed using a combination of an IDL and its compiler together
    with some program code.  Hector provides a graphical editor for
    Interface and Binding type manipulation.  It allows the
    description of the Interface events, their sequencing constraints
    and the connection between Interfaces to form Bindings.

    <p>

    A Capsule Browser provides a means to manage the Capsules running
    across a network.  The browser can display the state of the
    Capsule, Services, Communication modules, Language Modules, loaded
    Templates and instantiated Objects.  A user can load or unload
    modules and templates, and create new Objects from a loaded
    template.

    <p>

    The Capsule Browser uses the Capsule's management interface to
    perform these operations, and this interface is also available to
    any other Objects with appropriate permissions.

    <p>

    Finally, the Capsule Browser also provides support for the
    fundamental Capsule services.  The Trader, Type Manager and Policy
    services are all accessible using specific control panels within
    the Capsule Browser.

    <h2>Status</h2>

    We are currently working on the second snapshot release of the
    core Hector system.  The kernel is written entirely in Python,
    with some services and the language and communication layers using
    some C and C++ code modules.  The current kernel and communication
    sources total just over 13000 lines of Python code, with the
    services adding about half that again.

    <p>

    The first release included a simple, UDP-based messaging protocol,
    a simple Trading service, a notification service, and supported
    objects written in Python.

    <p>

    The next release will include

    <ul>
      <li>a Notification service,
      <li>a Naming service,
      <li>a Trading service,
      <li>a Type service, and,
      <li>a Policy service,
    </ul>

    and has had major extensions to the underlying implementation of
    Bindings.  It retains the simple messaging protocol and Python
    language binding from the previous release.

    <p>


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>Future</h2>

    We have several major work items planned, probably due for
    completion late in 1996.  Most important are several different
    communication protocols to augment our current prototype.

    <p>

    While we have not yet chosen any particular protocols, those that
    interest us include

    <ul>
      <li>SMTP email (Unix sendmail <a href="#smtp">[11]</a>)
      <li>HTTP <a href="#http">[12]</a>
      <li>CORBA IIOP <a href="#corba">[13]</a>
      <li>DCE
      <li>Sun (ONC) RPC <a href="#onc">[14]</a>
    </ul>

    We have also done some preliminary work on a language binding to
    C++.  This will probably be integrated with the core system in the
    next release.

    <p>

    We are also investigating support for Java (of course!) and
    ParcPlace VisualWorks Smalltalk (which is heavily used by another
    local project).

    <p>

    Additional plans include implementation of the Relationships and
    Banking services, which together with a parallel project to
    provide the security services are expected to complete the
    fundamental services of the core system.

    <p>

    Further distant, work is planned for customisable, distributed
    user interface services <a href="#mansfield">[15]</a> and object
    migration and persistence services <a href="#redhead">[16]</a>.
