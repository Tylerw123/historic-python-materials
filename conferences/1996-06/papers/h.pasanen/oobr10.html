<H2>Building an environment</H2></A>
<P>
OO-Browser stores the browsing results into an environment, which is a
prebuilt lisp file that can quickly be loaded into memory.  In the
following steps we will build an environment for browsing Tkintern
classes.<P>
Hit C-c C-o to invoke OO-Browser. You will be greeted with a prompt <P>
<PRE>
Load/Create OO-Browser Environment: /usr2/src/oobr/
</PRE>
/usr2/src/oobr/ is the default path, which is formed by taking the
path for the current buffer.  The default name for the environment
file is OOBR, but you can name it to your liking.<P>
After this you are asked to choose the language:<P>
<PRE>
Choose: 1) C++; 2) Python:
</PRE>
I have configured my OO-Browser to offer browsing for C++ and Python only.
When you have selected Python, you will be flashed a message like<P>
<PRE>
``/usr2/src/oobr/OOBR'', no such file.
</PRE>
and then you are asked to start specifying the environment<P>
<PRE>
Please specify the ``OOBR'' Environment (Hit RTN to begin).
</PRE>
After hitting the requested <B>Enter</B> key, you will be prompted for
the source directories.  OO-Browser divides the source directories into
two categories: <I>System directories </I> and <I>Library directories</I>.  
For system directories you are supposed to enter those directories
that contain your still evolving source code.  Library directories are
meant for stable, reusable sources.  OO-Browser recursively searches
the subdirectories of all the given directories, so only separate
directory trees need to be entered.  (It is possible to exclude 
subdirectories by setting the BR-SKIP-DIR-REGEXPS variable.)<P>

<PRE>
System search dir #1 (RTN to end): 
</PRE>
As we are just looking at the Tkintern classes this time, we leave the
system search directory empty. For the following prompt of library
directories we will enter the Tkintern directory.<P>
<PRE>
Library search dir #1 (RTN to end): /usr/local/lib/python/tkinter/
</PRE>
We just hit <B>Enter</B> for the second library directory.  After that
the <TT>Loading Environment... </TT> message will flash by, and the
OO-Browser will greet you with these two prompts:<P>
<PRE>
Build Environment from spec in file, ``/usr2/src/oobr/OOBR''? (y or n)
Build Environment in a background process? (y or n)
</PRE>
Just hit 'y' and 'n'.<P>
Depending on the amount of the source code, it may be useful to create
the environment in a background process. However, building an
environment for the full /usr/local/lib/python tree, with 38363 lines
of source code, only takes about 1.5 minutes on my 486/120MHz, running
Linux.<P>
After the build is finished, OO-Browser creates the browse windows and
display the available Tkintern classes.<P>
