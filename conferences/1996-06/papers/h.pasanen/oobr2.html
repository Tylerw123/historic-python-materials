<H2>Introduction to OO-Browser</H2></A>
<P>
OO-Browser is an object oriented browser for multiple programming languages, 
implemented under Emacs editor, mainly in Elisp.<P>
As Bob Weiner says in the documentation:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The OO-Browser is a multi-windowed, interactive object-oriented 
class browsersimilar in use to the well-known Smalltalk browsers.  It is 
unique in a number of respects foremost of which is that it works well with a
multiplicity of object-oriented languages.  It provides both textual
views within an editor and graphical views under the X window system.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
OO-Browser was developed during 1990-95 by Bob Weiner at Motorola Inc.
Motorola has donated the program to the Free Software Foundation under the 
terms of the GNU Public License.<P>
