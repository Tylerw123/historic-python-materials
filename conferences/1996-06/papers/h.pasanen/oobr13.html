<H2>Limitations</H2></A>
<P>
OO-Browser does not cope well in a situation where a class with a same
name is defined in multiple source files in an OO-browser environment.<P>
It is not possible to see where a certain class is used, this <I>
has-a</I> type relation is unsupported.<P>
In the Python support a shortcut was done in that no nested classes
are supported.  <P>
The browsing is based on static analysis of the python source code.
This excludes built-in modules from the browsing.  However, it would
be relatively simple to build a python program that generates a python
source code containing at least the function names and documentation
strings in a format parsable by OO-Browser.  Another drawback with
just browsing the source is that due to dynamic nature of Python, it
is possible to add methods to class instances at runtime, or even to
create new classes.  Naturally browsing these kinds of dynamic
structures is currently impossible.  Extending OO-Browser to the
direction of debugging a live Python process would enable live object
browsing.<P>
