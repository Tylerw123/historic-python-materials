<H3>Abstract</H3>
As an interpreted language, Python is extensible in a number of important
ways.  The author has taken advantage of this aspect of the language in the
implementation of a multi-featured and extensible mail and Web form handling
and processing application.  This paper explores some of the methods by which
Python has proven itself to be the perfect choice for this application and
for others in this domain.

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<a href="http://www.csn.net/~mhand/DipPouch">Diplomacy</a> is a multi-player
game published by The Avalon Hill Game Company.  The favorite game of both
John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger, Diplomacy is a true chanceless
battle of wits.

Because it involves a considerable amount of negotiation between players
before orders for the various pieces on the board are decided, the game of
Diplomacy adapts perfectly for e-mail based play.

After a negotiation period, the orders entered by each player for every
gamepiece under his or her control are adjudicated simultaneously, and the
results (success or failure) of each player's moves are determined based on the
actions of the pieces controlled by the other players.
<P>
The play of Diplomacy is supported over e-mail by a public domain application
simply known as
<a href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Sources/dipsrc.v8.0.tar.Z">the
"judge."</a> Developed by <a href="mailto:ken@cac.washington.edu">Ken Lowe</a>
and now maintained by a large <a href="mailto:judge-maint@nda.com">team of
programmers</a>, the judge is written in C and runs at a large number of sites
worldwide.  Diplomacy players issue orders and publish and distribute
so-called "press" messages by sending e-mail to the judge account.  The judge
program then "reads" this mail and responds to it appropriately after taking
any requested action.
<P>
The game of Diplomacy is uniquely variantizable.  By this, it is meant that
the basic ruleset of the game may be taken wholesale from its standard setting
on a map of turn-of-the-century Europe to any number of different gameboards.
Additionally, the rules themselves have proven malleable enough to have spawned
a great multitude of cataloged variant games, and new variants appear at all
times.

It has been an often unworkable chore for the current judge to support the
play of these many Diplomacy variants.
<P>
Beyond this, the current judge software is completely e-mail based, and to
enable the play of Diplomacy using the World Wide Web would entail either
a sophisticated CGI adapter program or a completely new adjudicator.  With
this in mind, I set out to write a new adjudicator which would receive and
parse messages sent both by e-mail and via Web forms.  The design goals for
this effort also included making the new judge easily extensible for rule and
gameboard variations.  This entailed the need for easy addition of new user
commands and parameters to those initially recognized by the parser.

<H3>Database Maintenance</H3>
At a high level, the adjudicator program would need to maintain two distinct
sets of persistent data.  The first of these would be the list of recognized
(or registered) players, and the second would be all data for each of the
various games being played (who the players in each game are, where the
different pieces are currently located, when the next deadline for order
submission is, which rule and "press" variants are in use, etc.).
<P>
For both of these datasets, the Python language itself was used to enable
quick and easy storage and retrieval.  At the same time, data in storage
is kept in a human-readable and modifiable format; it is in fact kept in
the native language itself.
<P>
Without getting deep into details, the code in Listing 1 shows the relevant
sections of the <tt>UserList</tt> class from the adjudicator code.

<blockquote>
<pre>
class UserList:
    def __init__(self, user_file):
        self.user_file = user_file
        execdict = { }
        execfile(user_file, globals(), execdict)
        self.users = execdict['users']
    #   ----------------------------------------
    def save(self):
        file = open(self.user_file, 'w')
        file.write('users = ' + `self.users`)
        file.close()
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p align=center><strong>Listing 1.
    <tt>UserList</tt> Storage and Retrieval</strong>
<P>
As is apparent from the code above, an instance of the <tt>UserList</tt> class
loads itself from and saves itself to a file on the file system, and it does
so using executable Python code.  The <tt>users</tt> attribute in the 
<tt>UserList</tt> class is a true Python dictionary (in actuality, it is
a dictionary of dictionaries) and the code takes advantage of Python's
ability to "print" dictionary (and other language) objects in parser readable
format.
<P>
With this simple storage system in place, manipulation of the data contained
in an instance of <tt>class&#160;UserList</tt> can be performed either manually
(by editing the file containing the executable code) or by any number of
distinct utility programs (including, but not limited to, the adjudicator
itself) which put to use methods within the <tt>UserList</tt> class, each of
which operates on the <tt>users</tt> dictionary object.  The ability to quickly
review the contents of an object by instructing it to <tt>save()</tt> and
then examining the file to which it was saved, and to manually correct any
problems in the data while debugging the class implementation is invaluable.
<P>
Notice that the <tt>__init__</tt> method of the class passes a segregated
local variable dictionary (named <tt>execdict</tt>) to the <tt>execfile</tt>
function.  It is this (initially empty) dictionary within which the variable
<tt>users</tt> is created and populated.  After return from the
<tt>execfile</tt> function, this variable is copied into <tt>self.users</tt>.
<P>
This technique is used due to a bug in version 1.3 of the Python interpreter
which prevents code executed by the <tt>exec</tt> command from properly
updating local dictionaries.  Python's creator,
<a href="mailto:guido@CNRI.Reston.VA.US">Guido Van Rossum</a> confirmed this
as a bug and suggested this approach in mail to the author, which was then
summarized in a posting to the
<a href="news:comp.lang.python"><tt>comp.lang.python</tt></a> newsgroup.
<P>
Storage and retrieval of the <tt>Game</tt> class is founded on the same
principle, although the class is more sophisticated than is the
<tt>UserList</tt>
class.  The relevant portions of the implementation of <tt>class&#160;Game</tt>
and a global utility function are reproduced in Listing 2, below.

<pre>
class Game:
    def __init__(self, game_name, template_name, variant_list,
                 power_tuple, player_dict, deadline_dict, map_dict):
        self.name       = game_name
        self.type       = template_name
        self.variants   = Variant(variant_list)
        self.powers     = PowerList(power_tuple)
        self.players    = PlayerList(player_dict)
        self.deadline   = Deadline(deadline_dict)
        self.map        = Map(map_dict)
    #   ------------------------------------------------------------
    def save(self):
        file = open(game_dir + self.name, 'w')
        file.write('game = Game(\n' +
                        `self.name` + ',\n' +
                        `self.type` + ',\n' +
                        `self.variants` + ',\n' +
                        `self.powers` + ',\n' +
                        `self.players` + ',\n' +
                        `self.deadline` + ',\n' +
                        `self.map` + '\n)\n')
        file.close()
#   ================================================================
def loadgame(game_name):
    try:
        execdict = { }
        execfile(game_dir + game_name, globals(), execdict)
        return execdict['game']
    except IOError, detail:
        if detail[0] > 2:
            raise IOError, detail
</pre>
<p align=center><strong>Listing 2.
    <tt>Game</tt> Storage and Retrieval</strong>
<P>
Here we see the same principle applied in a slightly modified form.  The
global function <tt>loadgame</tt> is tasked with executing an assignment
statement which is contained by an auxiliary file, and with returning the
assigned variable as the result of the function call.  The variable assignment
is a <tt>Game</tt> class member instantiation, and this class contains a
<tt>save</tt> method which reconstructs the assignment statement in the
auxiliary file.  Here we see that the auxiliary file is actually given a
name which reflects the <tt>game_name</tt> of the object it instantiates.
In this way, multiple instances of an object type can be supported.  This
contrasts with the <tt>UserList</tt> class, which has no need to provide
this functionality, and which therefore has a simpler implementation.
<P>
As can be seen, the <tt>Game</tt> class is sufficiently complex that it
contains a larger number of data attributes than does the <tt>UserList</tt>
class, and many of these are instances of other classes.  These other classes
(<tt>Variant</tt>, <tt>Deadline</tt>, etc.) each contain a single data
attribute, either a Python list or a Python dictionary object.  In this way,
the <tt>__repr__</tt> method provided for each of these classes easily
generates a printable form of the class instance,
and one which is immediately Python-loadable for use in the <tt>__init__</tt>
method.

<H4>Plug and Play</H4>

Another important requirement of the application being discussed is
extensibility of the recognized command set.  Since new game variants are
forever being
defined, and since new functionality is always being suggested for support
by an adjudicator, the application must be made easily extensible in this
respect.  The design goal, then, is that new user commands -- new ways by which
data elements (such as <tt>Game</tt> instances) may be altered by the user --
must be easily integrated into the application.
<P>
With the Lowe judge (written in C), enhancements and alterations
are the end result of a long and drawn-out development process.  The
volunteer maintenance team works on an <em>ad hoc</em> schedule, and new
platform issues are resolved
with each numbered software release, when the software is built on each
target machine.  The code itself has grown sufficiently complex that a person
who has developed even a simple game variant or new user command must solicit
for an expert on the maintenance team to enhance the code for the next release.
<P>
In the Python application, the language itself provides a true ease of
extension.  As with data storage and retrieval, the chosen mechanism is
the <tt>execfile</tt> function.
<P>
As with the current judge, the Python implementation supports a number
of commands which appear in the incoming (e-mail or Web form generated)
message.  Each of these commands occupy their own physical line of text,
and must begin with a keyword specifying the command type.  In the Python
implementation, there is no command list, no textual comparison, no function
table, and no "case" statement, each of which would require maintenance for
every enhancement.  Instead, Python itself is used to enable quick
location and execution of the relevant code for each command.  This also
enables any Python-fluent developer to very easily extend the application.
<P>
Consider the excerpt from the <tt>ProcessBody</tt> method of
<tt>class Message</tt>, shown in Listing 3.  This code looks at each text
line in a message body and performs the single command requested thereby:
<pre>
#   -----------------------------------------------------------------
#   Set up a variables dictionary for use by the code which performs
#   any requested command.  This dictionary contains the complete set
#   of variables exported to such code.  A list and description of
#   these variables, including their possible values when a command
#   is invoked, is all the knowledge needed for any developer to add
#   support for a new command to the application.
#   -----------------------------------------------------------------
execdict = {    'user':     self.user,  'address':  self.address,
                'game':     None,       'role':     None,
                'response': response,   'userbase': self.userbase }
#   ---------------------------------
#   Get each line in the message body
#   ---------------------------------
for textline in self.body:
    #   -------------------------------------------------
    #   Convert the line to lower-case letters and fill a
    #   list to contain each (whitespace-separated) word.
    #   (The first word is the command to be performed,
    #   and empty lines are ignored.
    #   -------------------------------------------------
    commands = split(lower(line))
    if not commands:
        continue

    #   ------------------------------------------------------------
    #   Load this list into the dictionary which is to be used as
    #   the local variable dictionary by the command-executing code.
    #   ------------------------------------------------------------
    execdict['commands'] = commands

    try:
        #   ----------------------------------------------------------
        #   Now execute the command.  This involves simply executing
        #   the code in a Python file (located in a certain directory)
        #   which was given the same name as the requested command.
        #   ----------------------------------------------------------
        execfile(cmd_dir + commands[0] + '.py', globals(), execdict)

        #   -------------------------------------------------
        #   Note that after completion of the execfile(), the
        #   contents of the execdict dictionary may have been
        #   modified.  The adjudicator command which was
    	#   executed may have loaded a "game", associated a
    	#   "role" with the user, etc., etc.
        #   -------------------------------------------------

    except AbortMessage, detail:
        #   ----------------------------------------------
        #   The command code may raise certain defined
        #   exceptions to indicate failure of the command;
        #   one of these is AbortMessage.
        #   ----------------------------------------------
        <em>produce diagnostic output, etc.</em>
        return
    except IOError:
        #   ---------------------------------------------------------
        #   If the file having the appropriate name was not located
        #   by execfile(), then the IOError exception will be raised.
        #   ---------------------------------------------------------
        <em>produce "no such command" output, etc.</em>
</pre>
<p align=center><strong>Listing 3.  Command Invocation</strong>
<P>
With this approach, implementation of a command locater is complete.  In
this respect, the application can be though of as being a mini-operating
system, where commands can be likened to executable files which are located
and run by an operating system when requested from a command line.
Regardless of the number and names of commands which are added to the
processor (ignoring such operating restrictions as the number of files which
may permissibly occupy the same directory), the code shown in Listing 3 will
not need to be updated.  The file system itself is able to host the one and
only list of supported commands.
<P>
There are many advantages to this method of command execution, including the
fact that one need not dive into code to know what commands are available.
Note that the command files to be executed are given the "<tt>.py</tt>" file
extension.  While this is not necessary, it does enable the file to be
dynamically <tt>import</tt>ed by auxiliary utility programs or even by the
adjudicator itself.  Importing code needs only to provide a local dictionary
containing the required local dictionary variables.  Thus, simply by using
Python's <tt>__doc__</tt> facility and the <tt>import</tt> command, 
documentation for each command can then be retrieved automatically.
<P>
It is worth noting that, alternative to loading "<tt>.py</tt>" files, the
auxiliary commands could be loaded in byte-compiled ("<tt>.pyc</tt>") form.
The code in Listing 3 need only be minimally changed to load and <tt>exec</tt>
this form of auxiliary code file.  In a posting to the
<tt>comp.lang.python</tt> newsgroup, Guido Van Rossum provided simple
instructions for converting a byte-stream which was loaded from a
<tt>.pyc</tt> file into an object which may be fed to the <tt>exec</tt>
function.
<P>
Regardless of the chosen form of loading the command code, this implementation
is also truly secure, in that the developer who adds a new command
implementation file has access only to
those variables which are passed to the code via the <tt>execdict</tt>
dictionary.  This contrasts with the C implementation, which, for the
same modification, would require a developer to open up the guts of the
machine, giving him the ability to introduce any number of errors.
<P>
A developer who adds a new command to those supported by the application is
also able to test his enhancements in a live environment as soon as he wishes
to do so, and the lead-time for introduction of new features is nearly
eliminated.
<P>

This approach is itself extensible, of course.  One of the commands supported
by the application is the <tt>VARIANT</tt> command, which can alter a loaded
<tt>Game</tt> object in a number of ways.  The code which implements this
command simply walks the list of arguments to the command, and for each one
attempts to execute (again using <tt>execfile</tt>) code in a file (located in
a separate segregated directory) having the the same name as the argument in
question.
<P>
Yet a further application of this same technique is found in the implementation
of certain of the <tt>VARIANT</tt>s which can be applied to a game.  To
contrive an example, a variant which, when set for a particular game, would
forbids certain players from negotiating with certain others, would be
implemented, like any other, by adding a Python code file which has the
chosen name of the variant (let's call it <tt>restrict</tt>) to
the directory in which the variant implementations are kept.  The code in this
file, using methods of <tt>class&#160;Game</tt> and the <tt>game</tt>
variable available to it via the passed local dictionary, would add the word
"<tt>restrict</tt>" to the currently loaded <tt>Game</tt> object's
<tt>variant</tt> list, and also add to that list some Python code (in this
example, as simple as a forbidding <tt>if</tt> statement, perhaps) which the
adjudicator will locate and execute whenever a <tt>PRESS</tt> command is
given.  It is a
simple matter to identify the few points in the course of game processing
when it is appropriate to have the adjudicator search a <tt>Game</tt>
object's <tt>variant</tt> list for code to be executed before proceeding.
One such point is the
invocation of a <tt>PRESS</tt> command, another is the advent of order
adjudication, and yet a third would be the distribution of the results of a
given game turn (as, for example, a variant may call for certain
move results to be kept secret from certain players).
<P>
Note that these code snippets, loaded into a <tt>Game</tt> object by
arguments to the <tt>VARIANT</tt> command, are persistent with the
<tt>Game</tt> object (at least until the variant in question is "turned off"
by a subsequent <tt>VARIANT</tt> command).  This, of course, is because
these "hook-catching" code fragments are actually saved to disk as part of
the object, and in a readable, reloadable form.  This brings us full-circle,
back to the first application of <tt>execfile</tt> which was discussed in
this paper.

<H4>Conclusion</H4>

This paper briefly discussed the ways in which Python's interpreted nature,
and its ability to execute auxiliary Python code at locations which are
determined at runtime can be used to great advantage.  Python offers a
clean way of storing and retrieving data in a human- and machine-readable
format, and Python enables the developer to write command or argument
engines which can be made completely independent from the underlying
implementations.  This makes Python applications not only very easy to
enhance but to maintain and support.
