<h2> Ariel - A Language Based User Interface </h2>

<p> Ariel is a research project to investigate the design of user
interfaces that go beyond the standard mouse and keyboard input
modalities.  It aims to take advantage of natural means of
communication such as speech, gestures, and facial expressions.  The
challenge is to understand the properties of these new modalities and
to uncover the appropriate interface elements to use with them.

<p> Under any of the current window systems, a set of standard
elements are used for building a user interface.  This includes items
like buttons, menus, scrollbars, and dialog boxes.  These items have
been stable for many years with a few changes like adding hyper-links
and image-maps as new basic elements that most user understand.  There
are also a number of concepts common to these interfaces.  Things like
"cut and paste" and "drag and drop".

<p> Many people are attempting to take these same elements and implement
them using spoken language systems.  Ideas like "speakable links"
where the user can say the words of a hyperlink instead of clicking
on it, or voice menus where the user can speak the items in a
traditional menu instead of using the mouse in the typical fashion,
are the standard approach to this problem.  These interfaces lead to
praise such as that found in a recent Time Magazine review of IBM's
latest VoiceType software.

<p> <em> "During our demo the system was impressive, though not yet easier
than using a mouse." </em> Time, May 13, 1996

<p> I feel that the great lesson to be drawn from all this is that
speech recognition makes a lousy mouse.  Speech (and the other
elements of language based interfaces) differs from mice and keyboards
in at least two fundamental ways.  First, these interfaces are
inherently noisy.  It is almost never possible to guarantee any
behavior of such a system with less than a 5% error rate.  Second,
these systems are extremely expressive.  Humans have been using
gestures and language to communicate with each other.  These differing
requirements insist that a new set of basic interface elements be
discovered.

<p> Ariel is a project to discover these primitives by building a
prototype system and working with it every day.  The thoroughly
overused personal information management task was chosen because of
its reasonable size and complexity, as well as the fact that almost
everyone uses some version of such a system every day.

<p> The project is currently 4 months old.  It consists of minimal
e-mail and web browsing capabilities.  The basic user interface
elements at the moment are the same ones as are found in other similar
systems.  (Well, you have to start somewhere).


<h2> The Quest for a Graphics API </h2>

<p> Building a system for research into user interfaces has given me
the opportunity to investigate the great variety of graphical modules
available for python.  I currently have python binaries installed with
the following GUI's.

<ul>
<li>TkInter
<li>Rivet
<li>WXWindows
<li>WPY
<li>PythonWin
<li>X11/Motif
<li>OpenGL
</ul>

<p>Almost all of these systems (with the exception of OpenGL) make it
fairly easy to create a standard GUI under python.  Many of them can
even produce code that is portable between different operating
systems, and some even run with the appropriate native look and feel.

<p>However, I'm not interested in the elements of a standard GUI.  If I
thought that these were the appropriate elements, then that's what I'd
be using.  What I wanted in a graphics system is as follows:

<ul>
<li>System Independent
<li>Generality
<li>NOT Native Look and Feel
<li>Speed
<li>3D would be nice
</ul>

<p>The X11 and PythonWin systems are platform specific, so they fail the
test immediately.  TkInter, Rivet, and WPY are all based on Tk (at
least under X).  In order to get the sort of generality I desire under
Tk, you must use the canvas object.  This is unfortunately much to
slow to do anything useful.  WXWindows was the most promising of the
candidates that I looked at (other than OpenGL); however, I found that
its great pains to maintain native look-and-feel (which is a big plus
to most people) were a big hinderance to my plans.

<h3>What is OpenGL?</h3>

<p><em>"The OpenGL graphics system is a software interface to graphics
hardware.  It allows you to create interactive programs that produce
color images of moving three-dimensional (and two-dimensional)
objects."</em> - OpenGL Programming Guide


<p>Open GL is a portable graphics standard, currently supported on all
major computer platforms.  Because the high-performance implementation
of OpenGL can be expensive on some platforms, it is reassuring that a
freely available implementation of the OpenGL standard exists (Mesa).
This implementation compiles almost everywhere that python does (not
including DOS) and is an efficient implementation of the API on top of
the native window system.

<p>OpenGL is fast.  It was designed to produce "color images of moving
three-dimensional objects."  This is an extremely computationally
demanding operation.  Speed of the basic drawing primitives was and
continues to be a primary motivating factor in the system's design.
With systems that have hardware graphics acceleration, this can
produce performance that is even faster than raw XLib coding (the
fastest (and ugliest) of the other systems considered here).

<p>The library's design is clean, easy to understand and natural to work
with.  It gives you the power to perform the finest grained
manipulations on the graphical output without requiring the sorts of
obscure technical details of working with something like Xlib.


<h2> Python to C - I feel the need for speed </h2>

<p>The great thing about building this project in python has been the
phenomenal speed with which I was able to go from nothing to a working
prototype.  Now that I have something working, there are one or two
chunks of code that are acting as bottle necks in the program.  The
standard python approach is to move these speed critical blocks of
code down into C.  

<p>Having translated a fairly large amount of simple python code to C
recently, I've noticed that much of the translation is trivial if I
include static types in the function specification.

<p>To use the most overused example of function definition, here it is
folks, the venerable factorial function.

<p><pre>
def factorial(n):
	if n == 0:
		return 1
	else:
		return n*factorial(n-1)
</pre>

<p> Now, what does this look like in C?

<p><pre>
long py2c_Factorial_factorial(long n) {
	if (n == 0) {
		return 1;
	} else {
		return (n*py2c_Factorial_factorial( (n-1) );
	}
}
</pre>

<p>The reason that some of the names are a little long, and that there
are a few more parenthesis than you might expect in such a piece of
code is that this was automatically generated from the python source.
Of course, the key to making this work was the addition to the python
source file of the following single line.

<p><pre>
#DECLARE factorial:(long, long)
</pre>

<p>This tells the translation program the signature of the factorial
function.  Without this information, doing anything useful with this
function is virtually impossible.  Including static types in this
manner is definately a sacrifice of python's outstanding dynamic
properties, but it's exactly the sacrifice expected in order to
translate to efficient C code.

<p>I've just recently discovered the MESS project, and it's
interesting to note that that framework involves similar static type
declarations for python classes.  What it has that this work currently
doesn't is the ability to declare a variable as a generic python
object.  This of course sacrifices much of the speed gains of
translating to C, so its not a top priority for me.

<p>The final step in the translation to C is to produce a python
interface to the newly generated C function so that it can be used as
before.  This is done fairly trivially with Bgen (since the function's
signature is known).

<h3>So what exactly can I handle?</h3>

<p>Obviously I haven't just created a general purpose tool for
translating python code to C.  If I'd done that there'd have been much
more fanfare, and I anticipate that there'd be much rejoicing
throughout the land.  Instead, I've gone a long way towards automating
the process of translating very simple python code to C.

<p>The key idea is that static typing has its uses, and that while all
of us love the dynamic nature of python, it can be very useful to
abandon it at particular moments.  I've had many situations
(particularly with my numeric code) where I've wanted to statically
type a function, not for speed requirements, but for code reliability.
I think that there are some interesting gains to be made by continuing
to work in this direction.
