<P>Serpent is a 128-bit block cipher designed by <a
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/">Ross Anderson</a>, <a
HREF="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham">Eli Biham</a> and <a
HREF="http://www.ii.uib.no/~larsr/">Lars Knudsen</a> as a candidate for the
<a HREF="http://www.nist.gov/aes">Advanced Encryption Standard</a>, a
competition sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
to define a successor to DES. Serpent is designed to be faster than DES and
more secure than triple-DES. It is in the public domain and there are no
restrictions on its use: the full AES submission package, including the
full specification of the cipher, a reference implementation in C, several
test suites, and optimised versions in C and Java, is available from <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html</a></P>

<P>The authors of Serpent had a preliminary C implementation and wanted to
cross-check it with an independently developed one. I started from the
paper defining Serpent and implemented the algorithm from scratch. My only
concerns were correctness and readability, with the view that
&quot;premature optimisation is the root of all evil&quot;. For this reason
I chose Python, and I represented bit strings simply as little-endian
strings of the characters &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. This gave me a
&quot;virtual processor&quot; with words of arbitrary length. I could now
easily XOR, rotate, extract bit 103 and so on, as well as assigning a block
or key to a variable and inspecting it (even interactively) simply by
printing it out.</P>

<P>It must be realised that implementing a cryptographic primitive such as
a block cipher from scratch is very much an open-loop operation, in that
there is no obvious feedback on whether the output is correct or not. After
all, the whole point of a block cipher is to transform the plaintext into
something that resembles random garbage as closely as possible -- so how
is one supposed to know whether the garbage that comes out is
&quot;good&quot; garbage or the outcome of some internal bugs? Compare this
with the much easier closed-loop task of writing a new implementation after
a known-good reference implementation is available: bugs are immediately
identified by the fact that the output is different from that of the
reference, and by tracing back the intermediate results one is quickly led
to the point of divergence and thus to the probable cause of the bug.</P>

<P>Short of going all the way to formal verification methods, a good
solution seems to be that of making the code as clear and simple as
possible, aiming for a one-to-one correspondence between the code and the
formulae describing the algorithm in its specification. A very high-level
language such as Python, with its &quot;executable pseudocode&quot;
flavour, was found to be great for this task.</P>

<P>The Python version was instrumental in finding a couple of bugs in the C
code that, while conceptually trivial, were still of course affecting the
workings of the cipher. The absolutely unoptimised Python code, while it
ran at the appalling speed of about one block per second (the C code was 4
to 5 orders of magnitude faster), was the first implementation to produce
the correct results. I later had to rewrite an unoptimised reference
version in C, since that's what the call for algorithms required, but
this task was made much more pleasant (and closed-loop) by being able to
rely on the existing Python one.</P>

<P>If there is a moral to this story, it must be that the level of
abstraction of Python makes it a good language for expressing ideas without
getting too bogged down in machine-level details, and that &quot;ideas in
executable form&quot; are a good complement to the formal specification of
an algorithm.</P>
