<P>The idea of visual cryptography is a fascinating invention by Moni Naor
and Adi Shamir (1994). See <a
href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/vis.ps">http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/vis.ps</a>.</p>

<P>In its simplest form, it implements an unbreakable (in the
information-theoretical sense) cryptosystem, rather similar to the one-time
pad, with the additional twist that decryption does not require any
computing equipment. James Bond carries a special &quot;key&quot; which is
in fact a transparency with lots of random dots on it; when M faxes Bond a
secret message, it too consisting of lots of random dots, Bond simply
places his transparency over the ciphertext and reads out the plaintext!
The stroke of genius here is the technique, explained in the poster, by
which the boolean operation of &quot;xor&quot; is implemented by means of a
visual &quot;or&quot;. I decided to implement the system after seeing a
demonstration of it at a brilliant talk by Adi Shamir himself. Since the
point here was not so much using the cryptosystem but communicating to
others the intellectual excitement of the invention, I wanted to be able to
display all the intermediate results in graphical form.</P>

<P>I decided to use the <I>netpbm</I> suite of graphical file formats
converters and I wrote a collection of small C++ programs, each of which
performed a specific atomic operation. The only problem with this was that,
to actually generate the slides, the user had to perform half a dozen
separate operations, invoking these executables on the command line and
giving them filenames as arguments (piping couldn't always be used since
some operations required two inputs, and besides it was necessary to go
through files to be able to inspect the results). Gluing things together
with a batch file or shell script was cumbersome, as well as not portable
between Windows and Unix. And it still required to run a separate image
viewer to display all these intermediate results.</P>

<P>For a while I thought about writing a VCK extension to Python, so that I
could use Python as the glue. But eventually I settled on Fredrik
Lundh's <a
href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>
(Python Imaging Library) instead. A tiny Python-only module,
<code>vck.py</code>, provides not only all the atomic operations but also
the means to view any intermediate result in its own window with a single
function call from within the driving script. Some example scripts and
their outputs are shown on the poster. The greyscale variant has also been
implemented: unlike in the C++ version, where I had to generate raw
PostScript directly, here I could simply draw the figures on a Tk canvas
and get the PostScript code for free.</P>

<P>The significance of this work in the context of IPC7 is as another
demonstrator of the language's suitability for immediate practical
experimentation (<I>making ideas executable</I>), which I view as one of
Python's greatest strengths. The Python rewrite of VCK took only a few
days, including the time spent learning the basics of PIL, and, compared to
its C++ predecessor, resulted in a much more versatile and practical system
for the end user, firstly because a convenient preview facility was now
available and secondly because the VCK primitives could now be easily
composed together by scripting. As an additional benefit, the code is now
much shorter, to the point that it is perfectly reasonable to show the
source to the user in order to explain what the primitives do. With the
previous version, this would have exposed lots of irrelevant code to do
with low-level image manipulation details. With the building blocks
provided by VCK, such as the &quot;bitmap&quot; class and the boolean
operations that take bitmaps as arguments, it is a simple matter for anyone
to add new primitives in Python to implement any of the many variants of
the visual cryptography idea that the cryptological research papers keep
bringing out.</P>

<P>This code is totally un-optimised and has been written for the human
reader rather than for the machine. The bitmap class exports methods to set
and get the value of a pixel, and every other primitive of the toolkit goes
through them. Most operations could be implemented much more efficiently at
a lower level; but, given the purpose of this work, which is more about
communicating ideas and enabling experimentation than providing a tool to
perform actual encryption, this solution wins both for the time it took to
develop it and for the advantage it offers of exposing the simplest
possible source code.</P>
