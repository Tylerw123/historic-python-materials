<h2>Abstract</h2>
 
<p>

The Generic Processor Control (GPC) is a portable and lightweight Job
Scheduler to coordinate the execution of hundreds of UNIX processes on
a single workstation constrained by a set of configurable activation
rules. Although originally designed for RADAR image processing in the
SRTM project <a href="#DFD">[1]</a><a href="#SRTM">[2]</a>, the
implemented features are fairly generic so that a broad range of
applications requiring an extensible Job Scheduler can benefit from
GPC. The current prototype is completely implemented using the Python
<a href="#PYTHON">[3]</a> programming language.

<p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>


GPC is a hierarchical and state-based scheduler with a fixed core
implementation plus embedded extensions for configuration.  The
basic units of execution are called <i>S</i>cheduled <i>Ob</i>jects
(SOB), which are classified into <i>Blocks</i> and <i>Steps</i>. Both
are arranged in a tree datastructure, with the leaves of the tree
being exclusively Steps and all other nodes being Blocks.

<p>

Steps are equivalent to ordinary UNIX processes while Blocks
encapsulate an arbitrary number of Steps and other Blocks. Each Block
contains local knowledge how to sequence it's child SOBs.  The dynamic
behaviour of Steps and Blocks is defined by a state-machine with five
states (Init, Run, Sus, Idle, Term) and six states (Init, Run,
Wait-for-Stop, Stop, Sus, Term) respectively.

<p>

The root Block is called a <i>Task</i>.  Tasks (including the full SOB
tree) are created when a <i>Processing Request</i> (PR) enters GPC.
After a Task is created it is pushed into a Task Queue where it waits
to be automatically or manually selected for execution.  After a Task
enters the terminated state, it is automatically removed from the Task
queue.
 

<p>


For our application a single Task comprises between ten and 800
process executions. These processes operate within a Task working
directory tree (workspace). Handling the Task workspace (setup,
cleanup, error checks) is also part of GPC's configuration.

<p>

PRs contain the parameters for product generation in structured
textual form (XML format). GPC extracts a PR's contents, reformats it
and places it at predefines places in the Task working directory.
Optionally PR information is used to parametrize the structure of the
SOB tree.

<p>

Configuring GPC means to specify the (a) SOB tree structure, (b) local
activation rules of each Block describing how to sequence it's childs,
(c) PR readers, (d) Task setup and cleanup procedures, and (e) Task
Queue selection policy.

<p>

A combination of the following rules can be specified to activate a
Block/Step: (a) state of arbitrary number of predecessor SOBs, (b)
arrival of arbitrary files, (c) activation time-window and (d)
availability of logical resources. 


<p>


<h2>Prototyping with Python</h2>


GPC has grown to an 18000 line program within the last eight months
(equivalent to four to eight times more code when written in typical
system programming languages).  Using Python proved to be fast and
resulted in code readability and quality impressively higher compared
to languages like C or Java.  Numerous powerful packages exist (e.g.
Tk, XML, CORBA) which boost productivity. Many projects, especially
those suffering from permanently tight time pressure and creeping
requirement changes, such as our's, can benefit by using Python.
