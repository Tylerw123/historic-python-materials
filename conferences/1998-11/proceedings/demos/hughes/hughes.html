<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction</p>
</b></font><font FACE="TIMES" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Python&#146;s high runtime dynamic capabilities provide an ideal base
platform to perform rapid development of graphical user interfaces. Ever since I ran
across Python and Mark Hammond&#146;s Pythonwin one of my big wishes was to be able to
develop Windows NT applications in Python, that support the GUI features and current look
and feel as seen in the major Windows software packages. So eventually I decided to try to
find a solution for this.</p>
</font><font FACE="TIMES"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Approach</p>
</b></font><font FACE="TIMES" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Based on Mark Hammond&#146;s Pythonwin a modified version of Pythonwin
was created to support one of the leading third party MFC Visual C++ extension libraries.
One of the main aims was to be able to program all features of a Windows application
dynamically at runtime, without the dependency of having to create compiled resources, and
needing to link them into Python dynamic link libraries (.pyd&#146;s). At the C++ level
support was added for creating resources for menus, form views and image lists out of
Python tuples. This enables applications to quickly create all necessary GUI framework
components for their display in Python, and it&#146;s possible to take advantage of
Python&#146;s rapid speed of development for this area, too.</p>
</font><font FACE="TIMES"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1. Supported Features</p>
</b></font><font FACE="TIMES" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the current stage of development support is available for many new
and advanced features that are provided by the MFC extension library we chose. These
include docking menu bars, docking windows, MDI alternatives for window management, etc.
Furthermore several new dialog, tree and list controls, and a C++ backed dialog layout
management, that provides fast window and control rearrangement when resizing a frame.</p>
</font><font FACE="TIMES"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2. Availability</p>
</b></font><font FACE="TIMES" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One disadvantage of choosing a commercial library was that we had to
accept the fact, that due to licensing restrictions the interfaces to these extensions
can&#146;t be distributed free of charge. Third Party licenses are required for
developers. Nevertheless I think these extensions for Pythonwin prove, that Python is a
competitive language for developing up to date GUI interfaces for Windows. Once again
Python together with Pythonwin is one of the only alternative languages besides C++ that
has the flexibility to support these kinds of features.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore by being very dynamic at runtime Python will help to
simplify adding web browser like features and dynamic forms functionality to MFC style
applications. With the expanding acceptance of Internet browser interfaces by users, this
is an expectation that will be necessary to be supported by future user interfaces of non
web-based applications as well.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3. Credits</p>
</b></font><font FACE="TIMES" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without Mark Hammond&#146;s Pythonwin for Visual C++ this naturally
would never have been created, so a big thanks to Mark for developing such a great tool!</p>
