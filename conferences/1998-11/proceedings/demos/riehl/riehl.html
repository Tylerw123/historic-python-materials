<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> Grammar-based Rapid Application
Development (GRAD) is a system for building Python interfaces
for legacy systems.  Additionally, GRAD allows large systems to
employ Python as an interface language, replacing custom and often
highly cross- coupled interface languages.  GRAD attacks these
problems using the grammars of other languages to build type interfaces
and generate extension code for Python.  GRAD allows interfaces
to be built automatically without the use of scripts, and gives
Python access to C/C++ pointers.  GRAD infrastructure has driven
other projects and yielded new capabilities, such as the PyFront
Python to C interface front end.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> The key to GRAD is the employment
of a target language's grammar.  Support tools used in internal
GRAD development illustrate how a tree structure is built from
a linear string of text (these trees are called abstract syntax
trees or abstract parse trees.)  One such tool is the C/Python
parse tree browser, which will be demonstrated.  Once a language's
grammar is understood, it may be used to build other data structures
that are manipulated or output.  Specifically, GRAD employs a
C/C++ grammar to generate object information that is processed
and emitted as Python objects and extension code.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> The prime benefit of using
a native grammar is that an interface definition script is not
needed.  All that is required for GRAD to generate Python and
C extensions for Python is the original C/C++ source code.  Our
demonstration will highlight the use of GRAD to build Python bindings
to C++ orbit propagation software.  Tkinter will then be used
to visualize the data generated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> To provide the highest degree
of compatibility with production C and C++ systems, GRAD furnishes
an intrinsic type library that supports pointers and handles,
(pointers to pointers).  This feature will be illustrated as well.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> Finally, GRAD has inspired
other products.  The most significant of these include Paths and
PyFront.  PyFront may be seen as an inverse of the GRAD system,
in that interface code is generated in C from Python source. 
PyFront is related to GRAD because it uses the Python grammar
to build an internal model of the Python C API calls needed to
mimic the Python input script.  It will be shown how PyFront may
be used to generate C extension modules from pure Python.<BR>
