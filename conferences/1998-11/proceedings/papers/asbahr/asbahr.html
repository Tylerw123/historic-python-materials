Abstract</H2>
This paper presents a global survey of current work on a commercial system,
the Beyond Simulation Framework.&nbsp; Research and development of world
simulation control code for real-time 3D environments is described.&nbsp;
General approach, motivations, architecture, benefits, and the lessons
learned are described, as well as future direction for work in this area.&nbsp;
The emphasis is that the dynamic scripting approach described here has
merit applied to the construction of entertainment and educational virtual
environments.
<H2>
1. Background and Motivation</H2>
The advent of powerful workstation-class 3D graphics accelerator hardware
for personal computers has expanded the potential user base and audience
for advanced real-time simulated environments for visualization, training,
and entertainment.&nbsp; Video games in particular have experienced an
enormous leap in visual realism, with games such as Quake, Unreal, and
Jedi Knight pushing the graphics envelope.&nbsp; The popularity of these
games in turn drives the purchase of faster and more feature rich graphics
accelerators.&nbsp; However, the cost of development of these advanced
titles is also growing.&nbsp; One consequence of this trend is the identification
and development of 3D graphics engines.&nbsp; These engines are components
of code from a development project that can be reused both internally and
licensed to third parties, reducing the time requirements and cost of development
of additional projects.

<P>While some of these engines are monolithic in construction and “tend
to be tuned to a particular content style” <A HREF="#[4]">[4]</A>, some
are evolving to resemble and extend the component model of scene graph
libraries like SGI’s OpenInventor and Sense8’s WorldToolKit <A HREF="#[20]">[20,</A><A HREF="#[17]">17]</A>.&nbsp;
Libraries such as NDL’s NetImmerse, Hybrid Holding’s SurRender, and Microsoft/SGI’s
proposed Fahrenheit system speed up the development of real-time 3D titles
by presenting a consistent, high level application programmer interface
to advanced 3D animation and rendering functionality <A HREF="#[12]">[12,</A>
<A HREF="#[8]">8,</A> <A HREF="#[18]">18]</A>.

<P>Despite the existence of these scene graph libraries, the rapid development
of new games and other 3D simulations remains a significant challenge.&nbsp;
Various development groups often reengineers similar game functionality
beyond the graphics library, indeed sometimes this development effort is
repeated by the same group for subsequent projects.&nbsp; No corresponding
reusable library exists for this “game play” logic and the simulation of
characters, dialog, weapons, treasure, and other story-like elements of
the user experience.&nbsp; Further, current batch-oriented development
approaches are generally not well suited to the challenge of tuning for
realism and fun.

<P>One solution is to develop a reusable object framework for game play
programming that is domain independent and highly tunable.&nbsp; This is
the area of research focused on in the Beyond Simulation Framework described
in this paper.&nbsp; This work carries forward the spirit of the Swarm
project goals of identifying reusable “scientific components” in the specific
realms of 3D gaming and virtual environments.&nbsp; Beyond’s goal is to
create a robust flexible system that enables the rapid development of engaging
virtual worlds.
<H2>
2.&nbsp; General Approach</H2>
Previous development of real-time 3D simulation software highlights the
challenge of manipulating and tuning the user experience. The standard
code-compile-test loop breaks down when developing logic and behavioral
effects unrelated to syntax and type checking.&nbsp; It is therefore considered
essential for tuning to be able to access and modify the state of the simulation
at runtime.

<P>As control code typically does not represent the largest consumer of
processor time, a scripting approach represents a reasonable trade-off
of execution time for runtime flexibility.&nbsp; Several recent commercial
games implement various proprietary scripting languages for controlling
game play, establishing a precedent for the value of scripting <A HREF="#[14]">[14,</A>
<A HREF="#[7]">7,</A> <A HREF="#[22]">22]</A>.&nbsp; For example, QuakeC
and UnrealScript are extension languages written for Quake and Unreal,
respectively.&nbsp; While these languages are particularly suited for the
Unreal and Quake games, they are not general purpose languages and are
not available independent from their graphic engines.

<P>Important criteria for consideration of a scripting solution includes
adherence to standards, support for debugging, portability, and object
orientation.&nbsp; Object Oriented programming in particular is an essential
technology for building extensible and reusable software components for
game mechanics.

<P>Dynamic access to the simulation allows for run-time integration and
testing of new modules, which in addition to speeding the development cycle,
also allows for the loading of characters, weapons, and environments that
extend the base classes currently running.&nbsp;&nbsp; For simulations
such as this, object oriented features like runtime dynamic binding are
also extremely important.

<P>While many approaches are possible, the Python language satisfies the
majority of the practical criteria for this project.&nbsp; The object orientated
nature of Python, as well as its elegant syntax and support for runtime
dynamic binding, recommend it for a rapid production environment.&nbsp;
The existence of cross-platform support on Unix, Macintosh, and Wintel
allow for an amazing level of simulation portability, which is of key importance
for the reduction of development time and cost necessary to reach the broadest
audience. Debuggers and profilers are already available for Python.&nbsp;
Further, the high level of extensibility of Python allows for quick integration
of third party libraries for rendering, sound, and network functionality.

<P>The applicability of Python as a control layer in large-scale projects
is well documented <A HREF="#[2]">[2,</A> <A HREF="#[6]">6]</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition, projects such as Alice and PUB demonstrate the applicability
of Python to gaming tasks such as virtual reality, interactive fiction,
and MUD systems <A HREF="#[15]">[15,</A> <A HREF="#[21]">21]</A>.&nbsp;
Alice in particular is pivotal in demonstrating both the power of Python
in a 3D animation environment and the ease of scripting it makes possible.
<H2>
3.&nbsp; Architectural Overview</H2>
The current simulation design consists of an object model that abstracts
world elements into reusable high level components.&nbsp; The simulation
is updated in an asynchronous event-driven manner.&nbsp; Underneath the
simulation layer and encapsulated in the high level components are sound
and graphic subsystems.&nbsp; The Beyond object framework complements a
scene graph library’s functionality such as mesh loading, animation interpolation,
and collision detection by emphasizing object communication, character
control, collision response, activity initiation, and abstract logical
interaction.
<H3>
3.1.&nbsp; Design Philosophy</H3>
A primary design goal is to develop classes that are interactive fiction
analogs (or simulation analogs) of real world objects.&nbsp; Achieving
this goal requires a feature rich and reusable protocol of methods that
classes implement to create interchangeable and polymorphic objects, resulting
in an highly flexible toolkit for building interesting and dynamic virtual
worlds.

<P>The objects collected into the Beyond framework are similar in approach
to Apple’s Application Kit class framework and Swarm’s multi-agent discrete
event simulation frameworks <A HREF="#[1]">[1,</A> <A HREF="#[9]">9]</A>.&nbsp;
In both the Application Kit and Swarm, objects written in Objective-C are
employ runtime dynamic binding to achieve flexibility in object design
and implementation.&nbsp; Beyond is particularly influenced by the delegation
model of the Application Kit.&nbsp; From Swarm, Beyond derives direction
for the object-as-agent and scheduling approaches.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Beyond is designed as a set of integrated modules extending the functionality
of the core simulation module.&nbsp; Simulations are modeled as a set of
interacting entities that represent both components of the world and actors
inside it.&nbsp; Communication between these entities is modeled as discrete
events at the behavioral level instead of the presentational level, similar
to the client-server approach taken by the multi-user Habitat system <A HREF="#[10]">[10]</A>.

<P>In Habitat, the presentation client running on a user's personal computer
communicates with a remote server over very low bandwidth lines.&nbsp;
This arrangement precludes transmission of the large amount of presentational
data required to fully describe a scene.&nbsp; Instead, behavioral data
of a higher level of scene abstraction is transmitted and the client performs
the work of assembling a scene locally.&nbsp; Beyond also employs communication
of a high level of behavioral abstraction between objects, but encapsulates
the logic for calculation of presentation within each SimObject.&nbsp;
This mechanism proves appropriate both for local object interaction and
for remote communication with Sim-Objects running on a peer computer.
<H3>
3.2.&nbsp; SimObjects</H3>
The requirements for the framework begin with a good root object that defines
a number of essential methods and attributes for subclasses to describe
and extend simulated object state and behavior.&nbsp; The superclass and
subclass objects comprising the Beyond system are named SimObjects, following
the convention established by the Object Management Group’s Business Object
Management SIG for “business objects” <A HREF="#[13]">[13]</A>.&nbsp; Business
objects are a useful naming convention for identifying those components
of a program that capture the logic of entities and processes in the business
domain that are independent from system specific or interface issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Correspondingly, in Beyond a SimObject is a representation of a thing active
in the simulation domain.

<P>As in the Swarm system, simulation elements are modeled directly as
objects, with instance variables representing the state and methods implementing
the behavior of the simulated elements <A HREF="#[9]">[9]</A>.&nbsp; Subclasses
define major game-oriented abstraction types, such as Room, Character,
or Weapon, which are further subclassed to refine and specify functionality
for a given simulation’s requirements, as shown in <A HREF="#Figure1">Figure
1</A>.&nbsp; SimObjects connect up to each other in the simulation and
their communication embodies both the behavior and the state of the simulation.

<P>Simulations are created by hierarchically organizing SimObjects in containment
graphs, where logically general instances contain more logically specific
instances.&nbsp; For example, a given Room contains a number of Characters,
each of which in turn contains a number of inventory items, such as a Backpack
which in turns contains a Lamp, a small Sack, and a Bottle of water.&nbsp;
Simulation events are passed from the top level SimObject in a depth-first
fashion to contained Sim-Objects, each level calling appropriate methods
on the next as per the logic of the given container object.&nbsp; It’s
interesting to note that a “closed” object in the Beyond system (a Room,
Backpack, pirate’s Chest, etc) will generally not pass events to items
contained within it.&nbsp; This serves as a way of partitioning off sections
of the simulation, allowing objects that have geometric representations
to effectively “disappear” from the scene graph as they cease to receive
updates to draw themselves.

<P>In addition to the general containment capability, Sim-Objects also
have specific “arbitrary subdivision” object containers that are used to
define important areas of a given SimObject, such as a character’s WieldedWeapon,
an machinegun’s Handle, the mounting point for a Missile, and so forth.&nbsp;
Messages can then be targeted as the specific slot and be received by whatever
SimObject instance is contained in that slot.&nbsp; In these cases, SimObjects
register themselves as delegates of the containing object for those slots,
or are registered as delegates by the containing object when containment
is assumed, as when a character picks up the item in question.&nbsp; The
slots have 3D geometric positions as well as logical positions, so that
any geometry represented by the contained object is appropriately parented
to the containing object’s geometry based on that position.
<H3>
3.3.&nbsp; SimObject Actions</H3>
SimObjects perform actions by calling and executing methods on themselves
and on other SimObjects.&nbsp; Actions involve the manipulation of objects
in the simulation, picking up or dropping, throwing, using, eating, and
destroying.&nbsp; Doors have open, close, lock, and unlock functionality.&nbsp;
Keys transmit unique identifiers to locks.&nbsp; Projectile Weapons spawn
bullets which are in turn SimObjects, and bladed Weapons directly causeDamage().&nbsp;
General behaviors are extended by subclassing to add new behaviors or special
effects.

<P>More complicated SimObjects such as player characters (those controlled
by the user) and non-player characters (those controlled by the simulation)
have correspondingly more complicated actions.&nbsp; The taxonomy of character
actions is a significant object oriented design issue, which will be only
briefly touched on here.&nbsp; Character classes are generally concerned
with locomotion (walk forward, backward, left, right, run, climb), object
interaction (attack, use, wield, pickup, drop), character communication
(say, shout, whisper), object exchange (give, take), and combat (melee,
missile, instant-hit).

<P>The bridge between logical interaction and graphical representation
in the virtual environment is constructed by the encapsulation of scene
graph subsets.&nbsp; A scene graph subset contains connected and malleable
pieces of 3D geometry that are placed, rotated, and animated by SimObject
instances.&nbsp; SimObjects initiate the loading of geometry from disk
or control its dynamic construction by calling methods of the underlying
scene graph API.&nbsp; They activate, deactivate, and set floating values
of various features of the scene graph API for the particular scene graph
subset they control.&nbsp; Some examples of scene graph features controlled
this way include texture mapping, alpha-blending, scaling, and other visually
interesting effects.

<P>This interconnection of logical and geometry representations enables
logical actions such as a door opening or a character walking to have and
to activate a corresponding animation in its scene graph subset.&nbsp;
These animations form the basis of world motion for characters and objects
in three dimensions, and are typically artist-generated, in contrast with
complete physical simulation in Karl Sim’s creature system <A HREF="#[19]">[19]</A>.
<H3>
3.4.&nbsp; Simulation as Scheduling</H3>
An activity is a collection of events represented as Python method objects
and arguments to those methods which are called on the owner SimObject
or on other objects associated with the owner.&nbsp; Activity events, or
actions, executed as method calls on SimObjects preserve encapsulation
and thus work in conjunction with method-bound logic.&nbsp; As in the Swarm
system, these structures are partial orders, time dependencies between
two events sorted by timestamp, or in the Beyond case, by keyframe <A HREF="#[9]">[9]</A>.

<P>In Beyond, activities are grouped hierarchically in an activities set,
which allows higher priority activities to subsume others lower priority
activities.&nbsp; SimObjects track the progress of their internal activities
and receive activityFinished() event notification when they have completely
executed all actions in an activity.&nbsp; This allows the SimObject to
change states, if necessary, and to initiate new activities based on its
state.&nbsp; As SimObjects proceed through complex activities, they may
initiate a number of sub-activities to accomplish a particular user-defined
goal.

<P>A special case of a activities is an activity associated on a one-to-one
(isomorphic) basis with particular animations of the scene graph subset
geometry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On initiation of this activity, an associated
animation is begun in the scene graph subset.&nbsp; Actions are stored
at appropriate keyframes in the activity, which allows animators to cause
specific events in the simulation to occur at exact times during the course
of the animation.&nbsp; This mechanism provides a precise way to indicate
that a sound such as a footstep should be played when a character’s geometric
foot touches the ground, or that a missile should spawn and leave behind
a trail of smoke particles as it travels through space.
<H3>
3.5.&nbsp; Autonomous SimObjects</H3>
While logically abstract, SimObjects connected with animatable scene graph
subsets become, in effect, virtual brains for the physical body represented
by the particular scene graph subset.&nbsp; The logic of the Sim-Object
determines the behavior of the body, whether magic sword, giant robot,
or transient explosion effect.&nbsp; This approach is inspired by the brain-body
control systems of Karl Sims’ genetically evolved creatures, using programmer-generated
behavioral logic instead of automatically generated state machines for
creature action <A HREF="#[19]">[19]</A>.

<P>SimObjects exhibit autonomous behavior by connecting sensory inputs
and effector outputs with an internal state machine. A SimObject can have
a simple or complex behavior model.&nbsp; In the case of creatures and
other artificially intelligent agents with complex behaviors, internal
state is modeled around the purpose or role of the character in the simulation.

<P>Currently these “brains” are implemented as sets of hierarchical finite
state machines.&nbsp; At the lowest level a state machine concerned with
motility controls the selection, initiation, and transition between motion
activities and corresponding animation sets.&nbsp; Above the motility state
machine is the behavior state machine, which controls overarching character-world
response activities.&nbsp; This includes interacting with other Sim-Objects,
for example taking damage and dying.

<P>Internal state can be represented directly as instance variables for
emotional qualities such as fear (flee from other SimObjects), anger (charge
or attack other SimObjects), desire (pursue other SimObjects), and can
be modulated by a representation of energy (the SimObject can be highly
energetic or very tired).

<P>The perception model for autonomous characters is similar to that of
the artificial fishes of Demetri Terzopoulos, currently emphasizing distance,
direction, and collision with other SimObjects <A HREF="#[23]">[23]</A>.&nbsp;
Sensors are implemented as concentric bounding volumes centered on the
SimObject’s geometry.&nbsp; The bounding volumes are submitted to the scene
graph library’s collision detection facility and the resulting colliding
geometry is assembled into one or more collision lists in the originating
SimObject.&nbsp; SimObject references collected this way are considered
perceived by the sensor in question.&nbsp; Collision lists are sorted by
type and a priority assigned by the distance from the sensing object.

<P>One example is a simple auto-tracking missile object.&nbsp; At each
step fo the simulation, the missile travels forward in the direction it
was launched until it comes into proximity with an object it can destroy
(or at least damage a bit).&nbsp; At a medium range distance, the missile
arcs in the general direction of the target, allowing the target a chance
to escape.&nbsp; Once the missile has closed with the target to the near
range distance, it arcs much more sharply toward the target and increases
speed, making it far less likely for the target to escape.

<P>Autonomous SimObjects need not be explicit characters in the simulation,
but instead can imbue intelligent behavior into ordinarily simple simulation
elements.&nbsp; For example, a “smart camera”, a camera with behavior logic,
can identify and track the main character moving through the simulated
environment under direct user control. Currently the Beyond virtual camera
can set a view target, a view POV, and perform various interpolations to
track motion between those two points.&nbsp; Future versions of the camera
could refocus on other non-player characters in the scene if their action
is deemed of sufficient dramatic importance, similar to Noma and Okada’s
calculation of view direction unsuitability function for virtual camera
animation <A HREF="#[11]">[11]</A>.

<P>As in Noma and Okada's system, the camera calculates an optimal point
of view location and direction of view orientation by solving simple functions
for weighted values applied to objects in the view space.&nbsp; For example,
if a character in the view is talking, her view importance grows and the
function shifts the camera to bring her into focus.&nbsp; When her companion
begins speaking, the weights shift and the camera moves to correspondingly
focus on him.
<H3>
3.6.&nbsp; Simulation Management</H3>
A SimObject subclass known as Application acts as the “simulation manager”.&nbsp;
The Application object&nbsp; (AppObject) tracks major game states and can
shift the simulation from one state to another.&nbsp; Each loop, the AppObject
receives a process tick from the OS Shell, which it uses to advance the
simulation through time.&nbsp; The AppObject messages its collection of
top-level SimObjects with process messages, iterating over sets of contained
high-level SimObject instances.&nbsp; The AppObject maintains multiple
lists of varying priority, and SimObjects can add and remove themselves
from different priority list for processing.

<P>The AppObject loads an end-user modifiable "boot" module which defines
the domain-specific responses to perform.&nbsp; The boot module contains,
among other things, application defaults such as the resolution of the
graphics window and the default mode in which to operate.&nbsp; It also
loads user input configuration files for translating/processing keyboard,
mouse, and joystick input for each of these operational modes.

<P>Key-to-object method event translation is handled in the AppObject via
dictionaries for mapping specific inputs to specific event outputs.&nbsp;
User input such as key presses, mouse, joystick, and glove movements are
resolved as requests to perform actions on SimObjects.&nbsp; SimObjects
messaged by the AppObject are required to support the Beyond protocol and
respond to events in a polymorphic manner.&nbsp; The key-to-event translation
and domain-polymorphism is largely related to the type of simulation loaded.

<P>The AppObject also tracks the current event focus SimObject and translates
events for the focus based on game state (and, of course, the configuration/translation
tables for that state).&nbsp; The focus can shift to be any SimObject in
the simulation, but is most often probably either a Console, GUI, Camera,
or main Character element.&nbsp; It is via this mechanism that user events
are distributed to the appropriate receiver for the given simulation state.
<H3>
3.7.&nbsp; Simulation Console</H3>
Another useful SimObject subclass is the Console object, which provides
access to the simulation runtime for tuning and rapid development. The
console is a simulation object given a time slice of computation along
with the other SimObjects, through timed event messaging.&nbsp; The console
polls for inputted text characters and assembled strings.&nbsp; When an
end of line (a return) is reached, the console gives the string to the
Python interpreter to execute.

<P>The Network Console subclass extends the basic capabilities of the console
by opening and maintaining communication over a socket.&nbsp; This enables
users to telnet into the application from a local or remote machine and
observe and manipulate the state of the running simulation.

<P>Because the console is a SimObject like any other and processed in the
same time-sliced way, users are able to give commands without stopping
the simulation, similar to lightweight threading.&nbsp; The console enables
the addressing, observing, and messaging of any object in the simulation.&nbsp;
Users are able to load characters, spells, and environment components by
messaging SimObjects directly, a very powerful tool.
<H2>
4.&nbsp; Embedding Python</H2>
The Python interpreter is embedded in a thin OS-specific executable which
loads the Beyond core and any proprietary libraries wrapped as extensions.&nbsp;
Platform dependent code is concentrated in this “OS-Shell” executable to
ease porting efforts between divergent platforms.

<P>On application initialization, the OS Shell imports the Beyond modules,
gets the Application class, and then calls PyObject_CallObject to instantiate
an Application instance.&nbsp; All communication between the thin executable
and the Beyond layer is handled through PyObject_CallMethod calls on the
Application object instance.

<P>The main loop is in the thin executable.&nbsp; At runtime, the OS Shell
collects input from various devices attached to the system, including the
keyboard, mouse, and joystick.&nbsp; It passes these input events to the
Beyond Application Object as acceptInput() messages.&nbsp; The OS Shell
makes multiple calls to the Beyond layer on each pass through the loop,
one for keyboard input, one for mouse input, one for joystick input, and
one for time-delta input, the time passed between this loop "tick" and
the previous.&nbsp; Certain operating-system events are handled directly
by the OS Shell, such as handling whether the application is “in focus”
or not.&nbsp; The Beyond layer calls back serious errors to the OS Shell
for user notification.&nbsp; The system also takes advantage of Python’s
capability to redirect stdout to a file object and also proxies the logging
data to the optional network console object.
<H2>
5.&nbsp; Subsystem Integration</H2>
One of the critical components of the Beyond system is a “platform” approach
to game development by remaining independent from the scene graph and other
subsystems.&nbsp; Beyond simulation code is written to execute ideally
with or without a graphical representation, either on the client side or
server side of a distributed game environment.&nbsp; Well written Beyond
code can conceivably execute in a game server for computing logical object
interactions between multiple graphical clients, as a multi-user dungeon,
or in a client program in text-only debugging mode.

<P>Subsystems such as the scene graph library, sound library, and network
communication library are loaded into Beyond as Python-wrapped extensions.&nbsp;
The process of wrapping and embedding is greatly enhanced by the use of
SWIG <A HREF="#[3]">[3]</A>.&nbsp; Functions in C are exposed as Python
function objects, and compiled objects in C++ are exposed as Python shadow
objects.&nbsp; Various subsystems can be given a common interface, enabling
independence from a particular subsystem implementation.&nbsp; Subsystems
can thus be mixed and matched for optimal solutions for particular deployment
situations.&nbsp; A diagram for data flow through such an arrangement is
shown in <A HREF="#Figure2">Figure 2</A>.

<P>Once mesh, animation, and texture data have been loaded from disk or
over the network, the largest portion of CPU time is devoted to geometry
processing and rendering.&nbsp; For performance reasons the majority of
geometry-related code needs to be implemented in a compiled language, and
is typically part of the C/C++ scene graph library.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Subclasses that deal with geometry explicitly import scene graph
modules which contain Python classes and shadow classes of the native scene
graph objects.&nbsp; Support code in the scene graph module wraps scene
graph function calls and presents a consistent method call API to the containing
SimObject.&nbsp; These geometry objects are registered to SimObject subclasses
as delegates, and thereafter receive those method calls intended for geometry
manipulation.
<H2>
6.&nbsp; Conclusions and Future Work</H2>
Beyond has been in development for about a year from various designs created
over the last four years.&nbsp; The original inspiration for Beyond derives
from frustration with the inappropriateness of the traditional code- compile-test
loop for virtual world creation and the need for a highly interactive means
of "reaching in" to the simulation. The system enables the development
of complicated real-time environments that have abstract logical as well
as graphical interactions.

<P>The current implementation of Beyond consists of 25 core classes and
a collection of about 15 game-specific derived subclasses.&nbsp; Simulations
of relatively high polygon-count scenes with many independent characters
have achieved run time frame rates of 30fps and higher on PC-class hardware.
Game simulation code using the alpha-level Beyond system consumes approximately
10% of CPU time running on a Pentium 200 with a first generation 3Dfx Voodoo
accelerator.&nbsp; The Beyond system has already been integrated with two
unique scene graph libraries, two sound libraries, and one networking library.

<P>Features such as the preliminary remote console has proven very useful
for run-time exploration and debugging.&nbsp; There is room for improvement
in handling exceptions in the system, and the need for tight integration
with a GUI tool for non-technical users is very clear.&nbsp; Additional
work remains to be done in determining the ideal balance between interpreted
and compiled simulation code, though initial results are very promising.

<P>In addition to GUI support, future versions of the system will include
support for object archiving and restoring, allowing every aspect of the
simulation state to be saved, complete with object attributes, and links
between objects.&nbsp; An improved Medusa-like network console is also
planned <A HREF="#[16]">[16]</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further enhancement to the
console could also include a more sophisticated interactive-fiction parser
like that in the PUB system <A HREF="#[21]">[21]</A>.&nbsp; Finally, there
is potential for integration with a free scene graph library, perhaps one
based around enhancements to the Python VRML module <A HREF="#[5]">[5]</A>.

<P>Development of Beyond continues today as the simulation layer for a
science fiction adventure game set in near future Japan.&nbsp; The public
will have access to the Beyond system as part of the release of the game,
anticipated in Q4 1999.
