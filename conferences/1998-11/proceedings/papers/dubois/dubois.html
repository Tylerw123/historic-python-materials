<H2 CLASS="Abstract"><A NAME="pgfId=289370"></A>Abstract</H2>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289371"></A>Python extensions are
usually created by writing the glue that connects Python to the
desired new functionality in the C language. While simple extensions
do not require much effort, to do the job correctly with full
error checking is tedious and prone to errors in reference counting
and to memory leaks, especially when errors occur. The resulting
program is difficult to read and maintain. By designing suitable
C++ classes to wrap the Python C API, we are able to produce extensions
that are correct and which clean up after themselves correctly
when errors occur. This facility also integrates the C++ and Python
exception facilities.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289372"></A>This paper briefly
describes our package for this purpose, named CXX. The emphasis
is on our design choices and the way these contribute to the construction
of accurate Python extensions. We also briefly relate the way
CXX's facilities for sequence classes allow use of C++'s Standard
Template Library (STL) algorithms on C++ sequences.</P>

is the problem we wanted to solve</H2>

<H3 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="pgfId=288435"></A>1.1 There is a
special fit between C++ and Python</H3>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=289427"></A>Anyone who
has extended Python using C knows that it is not hard to get something
simple working fast. There is even a small Tk-based GUI that will
write the framework of a C extension which you can just fill in.
However, once you attempt to write an extension of any significant
size or complexity, you quickly find it is difficult to maintain
correctness, and that the main size and complexity of your program
quickly becomes dominated by the extensive coding required for
detecting errors and maintaining correct reference counts.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289404"></A>Attempts have been
made to enhance the writing of Python extensions within the C
language setting. These include work by Don Beaudry2, Jim Fulton3,
and David Beasley4. Our work is in a different direction.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288451"></A>We are using Python
as part of a steering system for a large program written in C++.
There is a strong fit between the characteristics of C++ and the
needs of the Python extension writer. We felt that a suitable
set of C++ classes could be used to alleviate these difficulties.
In particular, C++'s facilities for defining behaviors during
object creation, copying, assignment, and destruction allow us
to get reference counting right. We describe here the package
we have implemented, called &quot;CXX&quot;.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289189"></A>Sometimes the most
difficult part of writing a Python extension in C is dealing with
errors. If you are part way through a complicated method and discover
that you are unable to proceed and are going to need to trigger
a Python exception, you need to release any references owned by
local objects. If you do not, a memory leak will occur. Depending
on the flow of logic within a routine, it may be very tedious
to keep track of which owned local references have been created
so far.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289206"></A>In C++, the destructors
of any local objects that have been fully constructed will be
called when an exception is thrown, and so on up the call chain
until either the job terminates or the exception is &quot;caught&quot;.
This will release precisely the right references, without any
effort on our part. By using a simple coding style, the extension
author can convert the C++ exceptions thrown in Python extensions
into Python exceptions, thus giving the Python user a chance to
regain control.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288452"></A>A secondary goal was
to bring the power of the STL to Python container classes. By
defining a suitable facility, we are able to directly apply STL
algorithms (such as sort) to Python sequences, and to use iterators
over Python sequences. Python sequences can thus be treated in
a similar programming style to that used for any other container
class.</P>

<H3 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="pgfId=289423"></A>1.2 Availability
of CXX</H3>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=289433"></A>CXX is written
in standard C++. The source code is available for free redistribution
as a beta release as part of the LLNL Python extensions distribution,
which is available at <BR>
ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/LLNLDistribution.tgz. Please
see the legal notices enclosed in that package.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289442"></A>C++ compilers are rapidly
catching up to the ISO standard. Suitably strong compilers for
compiling CXX are available on the platforms of interest to us.
Nonetheless, some compilers are not yet able to compile CXX due
to its use of modern template techniques and namespaces. A small
configuration file provides an attempt at a work-around for the
namespace problem. In our own testing, C++ compilers from Microsoft
(Visual C++ 5.0 SP3 or later) and from Kuck and Associates have
been used successfully. We have heard of other successes but do
not have a complete list.</P>

<H2 CLASS="Heading1"><A NAME="pgfId=288497"></A>2.0 Each Python
type is wrapped by a class</H2>

<P><div><dd><IMG SRC="cxx-1.gif" WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="11" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </dd></div></P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288487"></A>The CXX class hierarchy
is rooted in class Object, in namespace Py. An instance of Object
holds a pointer to a Python object and owns a reference to that
object. When this instance is destroyed, the destructor decrements
the Python object's reference count. An Object can be created
that holds a pointer to any kind of Python object. The Object
class contains methods that correspond to each of the general
Python operations. Binary operators such as plus are defined so
that we have access to those behaviors for Objects. Stream output
is defined to use the object's string representation str().</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288501"></A>Sometimes we want to
work with the properties of Python objects that are specific to
their actual type. We define descendants of Object for each of
the Python types; these more specific classes test the Python
object to which they are going to point to make sure it is a proper
member of the desired type. When this test fails, an exception
is thrown. Thus, creating an instance of one of these more specific
types not only gives us access to the API appropriate to such
an object, it also acts as a runtime type-check.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288498"></A>Here is a simple example.
The following program fragment is part of the test routine for
the Dict class. Dict, List, String, and Int are CXX classes which
correspond to Python's dictionary, list, string, and integer objects.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288462"></A>&nbsp;	Dict a, b;
<A NAME="pgfId=288463"></A>&nbsp;	List v;
<A NAME="pgfId=288464"></A>&nbsp;	String s (&quot;two&quot;);
<A NAME="pgfId=288465"></A>&nbsp;	a [&quot;one&quot;] = Int(1);
<A NAME="pgfId=288466"></A>&nbsp;	a [s] = Int(2);
<A NAME="pgfId=288467"></A>&nbsp;	a [&quot;three&quot;] = Int(3);
	v = a.values ();
<A NAME="pgfId=288472"></A>&nbsp;	sort (v.begin (), v.end ());
	b = a;
<A NAME="pgfId=288479"></A>&nbsp;	b.clear();</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body">Here we see that a Python dictionary object a
is created, and three key/value pairs are added to it. Then the
list of values in extracted into a Python list object, and the
list object is sorted using the STL algorithm sort. Finally, a
second reference b to the dictionary is created, and the dictionary-specific
method clear is called to empty it.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">Note that at any point if an error had occurred
in one of the underlying calls to the Python C API, the result
would have been the propagation of an exception. In the act of
leaving the routine that contains the above fragment, the objects
we had created would be correctly destroyed.</P>

<div>

<H3 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="pgfId=288524"></A>2.1 Special facilities
are provided for sequences</H3>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=288529"></A>Note that
in the previous example we were able to use the STL algorithm
sort on an instance of class List. This is possible because each
of the classes in CXX that corresponds to a sequence type in Python
has been declared to inherit from a special templated class SeqBase&lt;T&gt;.
Here the template parameter T is intended to be some descendent
of Object which defines the most specific type expected for the
element of the sequence. Of course, for the standard Python sequences,
this type is Object itself: that is, the most we know about an
element of a Python list is that it is an Object. Since this is
such a common case, the name Sequence is available as a short-hand
for SeqBase&lt;Object&gt;.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288530"></A>SeqBase&lt;T&gt; defines
a number of facilities that assist the C++ programmer in dealing
with sequences. These are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI CLASS="Bulleted">s [i] is the ith element of the sequence.
  <LI CLASS="Bulleted">Contained classes iterator and const_iterator
  are defined for read/write and read-only traversals. For example,
  to print out each item of a list using stream I/O, we might do:
</UL>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=297732"></A>&nbsp;		List mylist;
		mylist = ... some list ...
		for (List::const_iterator j = mylist.begin();
<A NAME="pgfId=297739"></A>&nbsp;			j != 	mylist.end();
<A NAME="pgfId=297740"></A>&nbsp;			++j)
<A NAME="pgfId=297743"></A>&nbsp;			{
<A NAME="pgfId=297741"></A>&nbsp;				cout &lt;&lt; *j;
<A NAME="pgfId=297742"></A>&nbsp;			}</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body">If you are not familiar with STL iterators, this
doubtless looks very strange to you. Think of an iterator as a
kind of pointer that when incremented knows how to advance itself
to the next item in a container. Traditional pointers can only
do this with contiguous data structures. Iterators are thus a
generalization of C pointers.</P>

<UL>
  <LI CLASS="Bulleted">Proper inheritance and internal definitions
  are given to make SeqBase&lt;T&gt; a proper STL random-access
  container, thus allowing use of the full range of STL algorithms.

ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </dd></div></P>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=288564"></A>Each of the
CXX classes has a variety of constructors available, appropriate
to the particular type. For example, class Float instances can
be constructed from C doubles:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288565"></A>&nbsp;double d;
<A NAME="pgfId=288566"></A>&nbsp;Float x (d); // make a Float whose value is d</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288568"></A>Each of the classes
has a constructor which accepts an existing PyObject*. The class
instance increments the reference count on the object, thus giving
itself an owned reference to the object. When the instance is
destroyed, its destructor decrements the reference count.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288570"></A>When a Python object
is created by a call to the Python C API, the result is often
an owned reference. In that case we want the resulting CXX class
instance to take over this ownership. (Since we wrap a great deal
of the Python C API in CXX classes, this is more of an issue within
CXX's implementation than it is for the end user.) To this end
CXX defines a helper class FromAPI whose net effect is to decrement
the reference count on a PyObject*. For example, PyDouble_FromDouble
is a routine in the Python C API that returns an owned reference
to a Python float object. Thus, were we to do:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288581"></A>&nbsp;double d;
<A NAME="pgfId=288588"></A>&nbsp;Float x (PyDouble_FromDouble (d));      //Incorrect</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288590"></A>the reference count
would be incorrect. (Of course, we would not normally do this
since the constructor Float x (d) would do the job much more simply.)
Instead, we should write:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288605"></A>&nbsp;Float x (FromAPI (PyDouble_FromDouble (d)));</PRE>

<div>

<H3 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="pgfId=297758"></A>3.1 No illegal
objects permitted</H3>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=288615"></A>It is part
of the philosophy of CXX that no illegal objects are ever permitted
to exist. Each and every CXX constructor must end with its pointer
pointing to a legitimate Python object acceptable to that class.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289551"></A>An alternative design
is possible, in which the pointer can be null as well. We came
to a decision after trying it both ways. The current design has
the virtue of eliminating any concern about whether an object
represents a legitimate object; in effect, we are eliminating
the possibility of a dangling pointer. No consumer of CXX ever
need test an object to see if it is a legitimate representative
of its class, because if it was not its constructor would have
thrown an exception.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289235"></A>The downside of this
decision is a burden on those extending CXX to add new types.
You must be able to (at least temporarily) construct a legal member
of the parent class as part of your own constructor process. If
you are inheriting directly from Object, there is no problem doing
that, since you can use Object's default constructor, which yields
a reference to Python's None object.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289268"></A>This is not the only
place in CXX where a minor inefficiency was accepted in order
to ensure correctness. It is difficult to measure the performance
effects of such choices without completely recoding the package
a different way. We have not yet had the opportunity to recode
an existing C extension to compare performance but have no concerns
in this regard; generally, minor inefficiencies in the compiled
part of an interpreter extension are insignificant for total performance.</P>

available in CXX</H3>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=288628"></A>The object
hierarchy in CXX is as follows. Inheritance is shown by indentation.
Besides the Object family, there is a family of exception classes
and some classes to help in the creation of Python modules and
extension objects. All names in CXX are contained within the namespace
Py.</P>

(Object ob) returns an owned reference to the object ob. In this
way the Python float object we have created to hold the answer

return from ex_sum. If you want a method that doesn't return anything
you return Nothing() and to signal a Python exception you return
Null().</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288802"></A>Note in this example
how the assignment g = a[i] not only extracted the ith argument

that the arguments be floats.</P>

we now need an Python &quot;init&quot; function for our extension
module. In this routine, which must have C linkage so that Python
can find it, we create the extension module and add the method(s)
desired to it, as well as any objects we wish to seed into its
dictionary (here, as an example, we add the constant pi).</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288811"></A>&nbsp;extern &quot;C&quot; void initexample ();</PRE>

<P CLASS="Code">&nbsp;</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288813"></A>&nbsp;void initexample ()
<A NAME="pgfId=288814"></A>&nbsp;{
<A NAME="pgfId=288815"></A>&nbsp;    static ExtensionModule example (&quot;example&quot;);
<A NAME="pgfId=288819"></A>&nbsp;   example.add(&quot;sum&quot;, ex_sum,
<A NAME="pgfId=297318"></A>&nbsp;                            &quot;sum(arglist) = sum of arguments&quot;);
<A NAME="pgfId=288820"></A>&nbsp;    Dict d = example.initialize();<A

}</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=297826"></A>The declaration of
example as static is to ensure that the object will survive the
call to the routine initexample. We could have also declared,
outside of initexample,</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=297814"></A>&nbsp;static ExtensionModule* example;</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=297830"></A>and then created the

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=297834"></A>&nbsp;	example = new ExtensionModule(&quot;example&quot;)</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=297321"></A>Note the simplicity
compared to writing the same thing in C, with its mysterious &quot;static
forward&quot;, Python type tables, etc.</P>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=288841"></A>CXX also contains
a facility for construction of new Python types. This facility
is not yet completely satisfactory, but we believe it is a step
forward. The key point is that to begin a new Python type we inherit
from class PythonExtension, which in turn inherits from PyObject.
Thus, at one blow we have made our type a descendant of PyObject,
created a type object for it, and created a function that will
check whether an object is of this new type. Then we initialize
the object in a similar manner to the extension module, adding
behaviors and their descriptions. We also write the methods in
a similar way.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288844"></A>PythonExtension is
a templated class, and the template argument we give it is, shockingly,
the class we are defining. This is an example of what Scott Meyers
has called the &quot;Curiously Recursive Template Pattern&quot;5,6.
PythonExtension sets up a Python type object unique to this type,
creates a static function</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289146"></A>static bool check (PyObject
*)</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289147"></A>that tests membership,
and sets a deletion behavior that ensures the calling of the class'
destructor in the case of its Python reference count going to
zero.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288845"></A>Here, for example,
is the start of a class &quot;r&quot; defining new objects of
type &quot;r&quot; similar to the Python range object:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288848"></A>&nbsp;class r: public PythonExtension&lt;r&gt; {
<A NAME="pgfId=288849"></A>&nbsp;public:
<A NAME="pgfId=288850"></A>&nbsp;    long start;
<A NAME="pgfId=288851"></A>&nbsp;    long stop;
<A NAME="pgfId=288852"></A>&nbsp;    long step;
<A NAME="pgfId=288853"></A>&nbsp;    r (long start_, long stop_, long step_ = 1L)
<A NAME="pgfId=288854"></A>&nbsp;   {
<A NAME="pgfId=288855"></A>&nbsp;        start = start_;<A NAME="pgfId=288856"></A>&nbsp;
        stop = stop_;
        step = step_;
   }</PRE>

<P CLASS="Code">&nbsp;</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288861"></A>&nbsp;   ~r()
<A NAME="pgfId=288862"></A>&nbsp;    {
<A NAME="pgfId=288863"></A>&nbsp;        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;r destroyed &quot; &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; std::endl;
<A NAME="pgfId=288864"></A>&nbsp;    }
<A NAME="pgfId=288846"></A>&nbsp;...</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=288876"></A>In a method similar
to the way we implemented the module method above, we define the
Python behaviors of the new object, such as r_repr, r_getattr,
r_length, and methods we choose such as amethod, value, etc. Then
in some module's initialization procedure is a call to init_rtype:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="pgfId=288879"></A>&nbsp;void init_rtype () {
<A NAME="pgfId=288880"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().name(&quot;r&quot;);
<A NAME="pgfId=288881"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().doc(&quot;r objects: start, stop, step&quot;);
<A NAME="pgfId=288882"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().repr(r_repr);
<A NAME="pgfId=288883"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().getattr(r_getattr);
<A NAME="pgfId=288884"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().sequence_length(r_length);
<A NAME="pgfId=288885"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().sequence_item(r_item);
<A NAME="pgfId=288886"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().sequence_slice(r_slice);
<A NAME="pgfId=288887"></A>&nbsp;        r::behaviors().sequence_concat(r_concat);
<A NAME="pgfId=288888"></A>&nbsp;       r::methods().add(&quot;amethod&quot;, r_amethod);
<A NAME="pgfId=288889"></A>&nbsp;        r::methods().add(&quot;assign&quot;, r_assign);
<A NAME="pgfId=288890"></A>&nbsp;        r::methods().add(&quot;value&quot;, r_value);
<A NAME="pgfId=297317"></A>&nbsp;}</PRE>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=297314"></A>Extension objects defined
in this way can be used in the same way you usually work with
PyObject pointers. However, they have an additional desirable
property that ordinary Python extension objects do not: they do
not have to live on the heap. Of course, as in C++ one must be
careful not to retain a reference to a local object after the
routine returns. But, with care, one can have the efficiency of
objects using stack rather than heap memory. With correct use
both new/deleted objects and stack objects will coexist nicely.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289472"></A>&nbsp;A wrapper for
this object can be created by using class Class ExtensionObject&lt;r&gt;.
This gives us a wrapper class that is a child of Object. The necessary
acceptance test used in this wrapper is r::check, defined for
us when we inherited from PythonExtension&lt;r&gt;. Such a wrapper
is useful as a wrapper of &quot;r&quot; objects. Unfortunately,
it does not contain any methods specific to class r, so to make
a really useful extension wrapper for class r we would need to
write one that inherits from ExtensionObject&lt;r&gt; and adds
wrappers for the methods of interest.</P>

<P CLASS="BodyAfterHead"><A NAME="pgfId=289057"></A>We see that
the strengths of C++ are a good match for the weaknesses in the
Python language extension process. Use of C++ in this way should
lead to much smaller, cleaner, and easier to write extensions,
with confidence in their correctness. Reference-counting errors,
among the most difficult to prevent and to diagnose when using
C, are avoided automatically, even in the difficult case of when
an error occurs.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289060"></A>Additional benefits
to this approach are the merging of the Python and C++ exception
facilities and the ability to write extension modules and objects
much more naturally and safely. The facility is completely extensible
via inheritance to the users' own classes.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289490"></A>In the future, we would
like to eliminate the need for the try/catch blocks in each method
and hoist that task up above the call to each method. Geoffrey
Furnish has done some work in this area but has not had time to
complete it. Recent additions to Python may also allow some improvement
in the extension object area.</P>

<P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId=289067"></A>Research remains on
further integrating Python and C++ but we believe CXX represents
a significant step forward.</P>
