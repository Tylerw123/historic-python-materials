<H2>Code Fragment Example Vars</H2>

We resolved that, in order to better represent the true python ethic,
we should avoid nonsensical pseudo-variable names like <KBD>foo</KBD>
and <KBD>bar</KBD>, and instead use more circus-conformant names, like
<KBD>spam</KBD> and <KBD>eggs</KBD>.  (The possibilities are endless.
Those of you that don't <I>like</I> spam could always just use spam,
spam, spam, spam, eggs, spam, and sausage...-) <P>
