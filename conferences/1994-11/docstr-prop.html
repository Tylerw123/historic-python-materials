<H2>Intrinsic docs</H2>

(As mentioned above, see <A HREF="custom.py">custom.py</A> for
an example exhibiting the proposed feature.) <P>

It was quickly agreed that python needs a mechanism by which textual
descriptions can be associated with any python object.  We propose
that any object can have an optional <KBD>__doc__</KBD> property,
which would contain the documentation string for the object, if it has
one.  The docstring could be assigned like any other attribute: <P>

<PRE>
	spam.__doc__ = 'oi dont loike spam'
</PRE>

We also propose that the definition syntax for callables (functions,
methods, and classes) and modules include optional, formal slots for
docstring declarations. <P>

In trying to resolve the form and syntax for docstring, we started
with GNU Emacs docstrings as a model, and went on to examine some
prospective uses for these things:

<UL>
<LI> jog of memory about an objects' purpose
<LI> more indepth review (online and hardcopy) of an objects' purpose
<LI> apropos-style search for object, according to its description
<LI> auto generation of manual, quick ref, finder; ~literate programming~
<LI> log entries, overviews <P>
</UL>

There was some vigorous discussion over alternate formats and
elaborations of the elisp docstring format.  One of the concerns was
capturing structured info in the object doc.  We eventually agreed
that: <P>

<OL>
<LI> in this case, simplest is both sufficient and best, and
<LI> the ':' colons in the 'def' and 'class' syntax should come before
the docstring, which would be on a separate line.
</OL>

(Re simplicity, some structuring can still be embedded in the
docstring, even in such a simplistic docstring sytax.  Eg, conventions
could dictate having the leading line of a docstring be complete unto
itself, for a brief description, like in elisp.  We could also employ
conventions to migrate towards accomodating html code in docstrings,
for more elaborate and prettier descriptions...) <P>

For callable (functions, methods, and classes) and module definitions,
we suggest that when (and only when) the first executable statement is
a string literal, that string becomes the value of the callable's
__doc__ property. <P>

For example: <P>

<PRE>
  def fondle(phrase):
<B>      """Innocuous foreign phrase => arbitrary, vulgar english phrase.

      Neither idempotent, commutative, nor associative, but
      respects tv censorship constraints.""" </B>

      code...
</PRE>

The docstrings should fall as a block at the indentation level of the
code within the routine, so the nominal left margin of the docstring
as a whole will be determined by the indentation column of the leading
quote ("COTLQ").  In this way, subsequent lines can be indented
further, but leading whitespace up to the COTLQ will be stripped.
(The lines should be considered to start at the COTLQ or the first
non-whitespace character on the line, to enable longer lines when
necessary.) <P>

Modules should also support an inherent doc string, as the first
object in the module. <P>

All formal docstring slots are optional - there need not be a string
there, in which case the <KBD>__doc__</KBD> attribute will be left
off of the resulting object, until it is explicitly assigned. <P>

The intrinsic changes to the language syntax would entail parsing the
implicit docstrings of callables and modules, and assigning them to
the <KBD>__doc__</KBD> attributes.  No forwards <EM>or</EM> backwards
incompatibilities with established python code is introduced. <P>

(One small, incidental change that would also be nice is in utilities
like the debugger, which should be made to ignore the initial
docstring when tooling functions for debugging...) <P>

It may be a useful to expose a hook in the language for processing
docstrings as they're being parsed (or assigned?), so they can be
systematically processed, eg to expand keyword references and/or
register them in a central 'apropos' repository, etc. <P>

In any case, this proposed feature leaves the door open for, but does
not define, utilities which systematically build on and employ
docstrings. <P>
