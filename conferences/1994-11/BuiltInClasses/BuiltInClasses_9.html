Deriving Built-In Classes in Python<P>
<H2>3.  Current Status</H2>
 The vast majority of the code needed to implement the Object System Enhancements described in Section 2 has already been completed and is already being used extensively here at V.I. Corporation. The portions which have not already been completed are currently under development. I expect that entire system will be completed no later than January, 1995. <P>
