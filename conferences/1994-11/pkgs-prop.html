<H2>Module Package-Suites</H2>

Python's import statement, together with the modules it produces,
offers a powerful, well-integrated mechanism for organizing software
packages.  It enables a degree of code organization that is necessary
to get beyond systems of a relatively small-scale.  However, the
current implementation has a few shortcomings, which we propose to
alleviate. <P>

The python module system currently offers no basis for affiliating
suites of modules in a coheresive way.  Also, the name space in which
modules are registered - <KBD>sys.modules</KBD> - has only a single
layer, so that the name of every module imported within a session must
be unique.  The former fact inhibits the degree to which modules can
be organized with respect to one another, while the latter leads to
untenable module-name conflicts, across name spaces. <P>

The proposal i brought to the workshop extends the import scheme to
address both these issues.  It does this by using nesting within the
module registration name space (<KBD>sys.modules</KBD>) to support
coordinated suites of modules.  We will informally refer to these
suites of modules as <I>packages</I>. <P>

In particular, the arrangement enabled loading of a suite of modules
as a unit, as well as loading individual components of the suite,
alone.  It also enabled modules within the suite to preferentially
load other modules within the suite. <P>

At the workshop we hashed out the proposal, and recognized some
problems, as well as some avenues for addressing these problems.  One
of the primary problems raised was absence of the means to access
modules outside of a suite that happen to have the same name as
modules within the suite. <P>

Out of that discussion came another of my big homework assignments -
to collect and digest what we came up with during the session,
continue to iron out the wrinkles, and produce a complete proposal.
After further work, and some hashing-out with guido, i have the
following proposal to offer. <P>

<H3>Module packages proposal</H3>

The essence of the proposal entails setting up a clean relationship
between module nesting and directory nesting.  It hinges on having
<KBD>import</KBD>s of directories (as found on the <KBD>load-path</KBD>)
amount to an <KBD>import</KBD> of the contents of the directory, into a
module representing the directory as a whole. <P>

The files within the directory are either module files, or themselves
directories which constitute module packages.  In either case, they
are loaded as modules within the package.  (Thus, given a directory
named <KBD>package</KBD> containing module file <KBD>module</KBD>, import
of the directory would result in a module named <KBD>package</KBD> and a
module within it, <KBD>package.module</KBD>.) <P>

When a package directory contains a file with the special name,
<KBD>__main__</KBD>, then the package load process is controlled by that
module.  Thus, import of a package need not necessarily load all, or
even some, of the contents of the directory, and special processing
can be done to determine what should and shouldn't be loaded.  If
there is no file named <KBD>__main__</KBD> in the directory, then the
entire contents of the directory is imported. <P>

Below is a description of each of the components of this scheme,
followed by some <A HREF="#questions">open questions for dicussion</A>,
then an <A HREF="#Packages summary">"executive summary"</A> and <A
HREF="#Package features">features summary</A>.

<H4> Importation of individual package components </H4>

Individual components of a package can be explicitly imported, by
specifing the composite module reference for the object.  For
instance, the above mentioned <KBD>package.module</KBD> can be imported
as a single entity.  Even if the package has not already been
imported, only the <KBD>package.module</KBD> component will be imported
- but it will be pulled in as a nested object, not as bare
<KBD>module</KBD>. <P>

<H4> Extension of the module load path using <KBD>__modpath__</KBD> </H4>

Loadup of the contents of a package directory is done with respect to
a special extension of the load-path mechanism, designed so that
<KBD>imports</KBD> from within the package prefer modules that reside
within the package.  The extension is based on the introduction of a
new variable, tentatively called <KBD>__modpath__</KBD>.
<KBD>__modpath__</KBD> would get it's value from a combination of two
things. <P>

A module's <KBD>__modpath__</KBD> value will be a list of strings,
inherited from the module doing the import.  In addition, if the
module is being imported from a package directory (typical when
<KBD>__modpath__</KBD> has a value), then its <KBD>__modpath__</KBD>
value would have the path of the directory prepended to it. <P>

Thus, within a package, modules need not specify the package name in
order to explicitly import other members of the package, and they will
inherently "prefer" to load other modules from their package, and then
other modules from packages which contain their package, and so
on... <P>

<H4> Referring to similarly named modules <I>outside</I> the package </H4>

One pitfall in the original proposal, identified during the workshop
session, was lack of provision for importing modules from outside the
package that happened to have the same names as modules within the
package.  This is a useful and necessary capability.  We have a
mechanism and syntax which provides an unambiguously distinct and
clear way for doing this - for invoking absolute imports of modules
from outside of a package.  <P>

The import command will recognize a special pseudo-module,
<KBD>__python__</KBD>, as a root for 'absolute' references to modules,
ignoring any prevailing <KBD>__modpath__</KBD> value.  This means that
imports of names that are prepended by <KBD>__python__.</KBD> refer
to top level packages along the system path, ignoring files within the
package that happen to have that name.  <P>

For example, a package could have within it a module named
<KBD>sys</KBD>, which can be imported from within the package as a
wrapper for the standard <KBD>sys</KBD> package.  The packages'
<KBD>sys</KBD> module would do so by using a <KBD>from __python__.sys
import *</KBD>.  Modules within the package would get the wrapper
module by doing an <KBD>import sys</KBD>. <P>

<A NAME="questions"><H3>Some Questions for Discussion</H3></A>

Here are some prominent questions for discussion that come immediately
to mind:

<OL>
<LI> Might there be better choices than '__python__' for the
     pseudo-root module path?  One possibility i've entertained is a
     null name, so a leading '.' would indicate a "rooted" path (ie,
     looking for a module name with respect only to the sys.path
     value).  This approach seems a bit radical, maybe a bit contrary
     to typical python constructs...
<LI> I've had a suggestion concerning the way that packages in a
     module share their extension of the load path.  It was suggested
     that it would be suitable to have a <KBD>__pkgpath__</KBD>
     variable within each component module that works the way i've
     proposed for <KBD>__modpath__</KBD>, except that the structure of
     the path list would be shared, so structural changes within one
     of the modules would be reflected within the rest.  I don't see
     the reason for this, but could certainly implement both the
     <KBD>__modpath__</KBD> and <KBD>__pkgpath__</KBD>, and make the
     default behavior use whichever seems more suitable.  Thoughts,
     anyone?
<LI> When a component of a package is loaded, eg <KBD>apkg.spam</KBD>,
     and the rest of the module is not yet loaded, what should
     <KBD>reload(apkg)</KBD> do?  Should it just do the entire package
     load, or should it fail, on the basis that the primary module for
     the package actually hasn't been imported.  I'm inclined towards
     the latter, but would certainly entertain convincing rationale to
     the former...
</OL>


<A NAME="Packages summary"
><H3>Summary of the proposal for Module Packages</H3></A>

To summarize, given an example package directory <KBD>apkg</KBD> which
resides on <KBD>sys-path</KBD>, and containing a module named
<KBD>amod</KBD> and <KBD>another</KBD>:

<OL>
<LI> <KBD>import apkg</KBD> would produce a module object named 'apkg'
in the current name space, and
<UL>
  <LI> apkg would contain two modules: 'amod' and 'another', 
       initialized with the contents of apkg/amod and apkg/another,
       respectively
  <LI> The 'apkg', 'amod', and 'another' modules would all contain the
       variable <KBD>__modpath__</KBD>, set to a list with one string,
       the path of the 'apkg' directory
  <LI> <KBD>sys.modules</KBD> would contain entries for 'apkg', as
       <KBD>apkg</KBD>, 'amod', as <KBD>apkg.amod</KBD>, and 'another', as
       <KBD>apkg.another</KBD>.  (The nested representation unequivocally
       distinguishes the package modules from other, outside modules
       with the same file name.)
  <LI> If the package directory contains a module with the special name
       <KBD>__main__</KBD>, then that module will override the default
       behavior, taking responsibility for loading (or not loading)
       the module components.
</UL>
<LI> 'amod' could import 'another' using <KBD>import another</KBD>, and
     vice-versa.
<LI> Modules outside the package could import, eg, 'amod', using
     <KBD>import apkg.amod</KBD>.
<UL>
  <LI> 'amod' would be initialized if it had not already been
       imported, but the rest of 'apkg' would not be.
  <LI> The importing module would get a module named 'apkg',
       containing the module named 'amod'.  It would contain only
       'amod' (and <KBD>__modpath__</KBD>) if other components of
       'apkg' had not previously been imported, and the entire
       contents of 'apkg' otherwise.
</UL>
<LI> Modules within a package can circumvent the <KBD>__modpath__</KBD>
     import preference for other components of the package by
     prepending the names in the import statement with
     <KBD>__python__.</KBD>.  Eg, <KBD>import __python__.rfc822</KBD>
     will obtain the standard system rfc822 module, even if the
     current package has a module of its own with the same name.
     (This will be particularly useful for creating module wrappers.)
</OL>

<A NAME="Package features"><H3>Features of the proposed changes</H3></A>

<UL>
<LI> Fully backwards compatable
<LI> Eliminates module name conflicts via suitable name space structuring, ie
<LI> Fully recursive nesting of modules as packages, which
<LI> Enables loading of module packages as a unit, with finer control
     available when needed
<LI> Enables package members to load other members with preference
<LI> Enables modules to load other modules within or outside their
     packages, regardless of name collisions
</UL>

<H3>To Implement Packages</H3>

I hope sometime soon to produce a prototype implementation of the
above behavior, using the <KBD>import</KBD> patches that guido recently
developed.  The features that should be implementable without changes
to the python language syntax are __modpath__ and loading of
directories as package modules. <P>

Once an acceptable prototype has been developed, guido should make the
parser changes necessary to accomodate extension of the import syntax
- composite module names - and the prototype should be completed and
evaluated for incorporation into the language.  (It would probably be
suitable to reorganize the standard modules at that point, beginning
to structure their relationships using nesting, and clean up the top
level modules namespace.) <P>

Hopefully, this and the above mentioned changes will be ironed out and
fully implemented for incorporation as part of python 1.2, or earlier
as 1.1.2(?). <P>
