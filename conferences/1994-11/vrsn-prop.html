<H2>Module Versioning</H2>

While it does not particularly affect the intrinsic language
structure, we found it easy and quick (and sensible:) to agree that
module producers should assign a distinct version identifier to a
conventionally named variable - i think we agreed on
<KBD>__version__</KBD> - within their modules.  Sidestepping a
slightly hairy (and probably premature) issue, we also agreed that it
was not yet necessary to decide on a common format for the value,
leaving that up to the module implementer. <P>

We left other python programming conventions and standards for another
time.
