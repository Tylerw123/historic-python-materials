| 	 9:00AM  Opening Speech by the Chair
| 	 9:30AM  "Position Statements" by all attendees

<PRE>
| 	12:00AM  Lunch
| 
| 	 1:30PM  A Standard GUI API
</PRE>

Is a Standard GUI API possible?  Is it desirable, even it it makes
Python applications uniformly ugly on all platforms?  How shall we
decide?  Session kicker: <A>Dave Brennan</A>.

<PRE>
| 	 3:00PM  Interfacing to C++ and inheriting built-in types
</PRE>

Interfacing to C++ seems to be the hottest topic on the list right
now.  Is it necessary to be able to inherit directly from built-in
types or classes?  Does the language need to be changed for this?
Does the implementation need to be changed?  Session kicker: <A

<H2>Wednesday November 2, 1994</H2>

<PRE>
| 	 8:30AM  Donuts, coffee, and discussion
| 	 9:00AM  Persistent Objects
</PRE>

Persistency of objects is a key to Python's success in certain areas.
Some groups have implementation experience with a limited form.  What
is needed is a general solution.  What is that solution?  Are language
changes needed?  Session kicker: <A>Guido van Rossum</A>.

<PRE>
| 	10:30AM  Safe-Python
</PRE>

We will try to find out what the needs are for a "Safe" version of
Python (see recent thread in the Python list) and how we can satisfy
those needs.  Session kicker: <A

<PRE>
| 	12:00AM  Lunch
| 
| 	 1:30PM  Steering Committee Meeting
</PRE>

Everyone is invited to the Steering Committee Meeting.  We'd like to
discuss organizational and political issues such as how efforts to
improve Python are coordinated and how decisions about the future of
Python can be made.  Session kicker: <A>Michael McLay</A>.

<PRE>

| 	10:30AM  Software Management
</PRE>

This is an umbrella for issues like:
<UL>
<LI> Maintaining and releasing large collections of cooperating modules
<LI> Module/package customizations
<LI> A standard for self-documenting code
<LI> How to begin writing a large Python program
</UL>

<PRE>
| 
|  	12:00AM  Lunch
| 
| 	 1:30PM  Python and the World-Wide Web
</PRE>

Hopefully an inventory can be made of available WWW software written
in Python, and what the missing parts are.  An intriguing subtopic is
how we can make downloading packages from the net less painful.
