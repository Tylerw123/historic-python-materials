<H2>Accomodation for the <A HREF="./">3rd Python Workshop</A></H2>

<P>A WWW search located a page listing some of the <A
HREF="http://www.digex.net/herndon/hotel.html">hotels in Reston 
area</A>.  The rates quoted by two of the hotels from the
moderate end of the price spectrum are:

<PRE>
   Comfort Inn - Herndon Dulles
   200 Elden Street, 
   Herndon, VA 22070
   (703) 437-7555
</PRE>
<UL>
   <LI> $72/night +tax	- standard  (for an individual)
   <LI> $70.20/night +tax - w/ AAA discount
   <LI> $59/night +tax   - the corporate rate (Just need to give your
						corporation's name)
</UL>

The Comfort Inn is a nationwide chain of motels which offer reasonably
well kept rooms.  The quality of service with this chain tends to vary
from location to location, but as the no-frills option for those who
are on a tight budget... 


<PRE>
   Holiday Inn Express
   485 Elden Street 
   Herndon, VA 22070
   (703) 478-9777
</PRE>
<UL>
	<LI> $79/night +tax - standard 
	<LI> $69/night +tax - corporate rate</PRE>
</UL>

Holiday Inn Express is a new chain from the old company.  They are
targeting the same market that was pioneered by Marriott Courtyard --
business travelers who want to be able to count on having
uniform room features with consistent quality.  The rooms are
comfortable and spacious.  Rooms with a single bed include
a desk, comfy chair, microwave, and frig.  I think the rooms with two
beds don't have the comfy chair.  The one in Menlo Park includes
breakfast, but that might not be standard.  There was an exercise
room, but not a restaurant or a pool.  It's a good value at $69 for
the Reston/Herndon area.

<H2>Transportation</H2>

The meeting is in suburbia so a rental car may be necessary.  There
is public transportation and taxi service available, but it would be
quite inconvient.  If you would like help in arranging to share
transportation costs, please drop us a note.

<H2>Other things to do</H2>

If you are traveling from distant lands you may want to take the
opportunity to do some touring of the Washington, DC area.  Early
December's weather can be nice, but it can also be cold and rainy.
Anyway, since all the Smithsonian museums are free it can be be a very
inexpensive vacation to tag on a couple extra days to your trip.
The metro takes you right down to the Mall so you don't need a
car if you stay at one of the hotels at a metro stop in the suburbs.
