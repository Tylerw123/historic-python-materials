<h1> Internet Tools Session - Session Chair: Barry Warsaw </h1>
<ul>
   <li> Grail was developed at CNRI create a browser that allows
        easy additions of protocols and other client side extensions
   <li> Specifically grail was designed to support the CNRI URN scheme
        "handles"
   <li> support was suppose to be in Mosaic...  Because of their "fall from 
        grace", we decide to (in addition to Mosaic) write a browser to 
        support handles
   <li> CNRI wants to deliver a browser in source code form that will 
        remain free (for non-commercial use)
</ul>

<a name="grail"><h1>Grail (Guido van Rossum) </h1>
<ul>
   <li> Complete internet browser
   <li> Currently at 0.2 release
   <li> support downloadable applets
   <ul>
      <li> code not bytecode is downloaded to client
      <li> security is based on 'restricted python'
      <li> security currently is 'loose'
      <li> More complete security is planned for future release
      <ul>
         <li> little 'rooms' will be the default
         <li> there will be ways to have applets cooperate
         <li> sockets will be tough perhaps user authorization on
              a per-connet basis (as longs as not too many dialog boxes)
         <li> apps like the chat-room are nice and should be possible
         <li> in the next version there will be better controls of
              the module namespace (e.g.  To modules named the same from
              different places currently are cached as the same module)
      </ul>
      <li> Mailing list for grail: <i> grail@python.org </i>
      <li> Grail is extensible in many dimentions
      <ul>
         <li> HTML tags
         <li> Protocols
         <li> GUI elements (menu's - more in the future)
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <li> Full HTML 2.0, http, ftp, mailto
   <li> Printing
   <li> Bookmarks
   <li> We hope to evolve grail into an environment much like emacs
        but much more platform independent
   <ul>
      <li> python better than elisp for configuration
      <li> not restricted to UNIX
      <li> eventually this could de-emphisize operating systems
   </ul>
   <li> portability of grail is dependent on John Osterhout's (and Sun's)
        ability to deliver Tk ports to the Mac and Windows
   <li> Grail is a bit slower than Netscape, mostly due to the HTML parser
        being written in python
   <li> Inclusion of Dan Connolly's W3C reference HTML parser (faster because
        it is written in C) is possible in the future
   <li> Can Grail interoperate with Java?  No.  No plans to incorporate
   <li> Guido: 'I would prefer to keep the Python language pure, and
        throw away all that Java s(tuff)'
</ul>
<a name="ssleay"><h1> The Python SSLeay interface (Andrew Kuchling) </h1>
<ul>
   <li> Problem: Credit card numbers in clear are bad
   <li> lot's of proposed solutions proposed today
   <li> Current leader is SSL by netscape
   <li> client/server negotiate an algorthm and session key
   <li> optionally, clients and servers can authenticate each other
   <li> provides easy security
   <li> SSL relys on the X.509 framework - certification authorities
        Tree based (unlike PGP)
   <li> SSLeay high level algorithm
   <ul>
      <li> Server only: generate and RSA key and keep it
      <li> Call SSLeay.fromfd() to create and SSLeay object attached to socket
      <li> Server only:
           set a public key and certificate with appropriate functions
      <li> call <i> connect </i> or <i>  accept </i>
   </ul>
   <li> SSLeay support was added to Grail in two hours (easy to use!)
   <li> SSL makes it easy to gain security
   <li> Python makes it easy to use SSLeay because of Polymorphism
   <li> SSLeay is still in alpha state
   <li> interfaces to other SSL implementation could be written
   <li> because of RSA's RSAref toolkit, SSLeay can be used
        without patten infringment.
        Currently not a problem (especially abroad since patten law 
        only applies in the US)

<h1> A Generic data collection system through WWW forms (Benny Shomer) </h1>
<ul>
   <li> Benny's employer manages one of the worlds largest biological databases
   <li> Problem: an efficient way of collecting data - and validating it
   <li> Benny has written some tools to attempt to validate the data
        on input using forms
   <li> Classes
   <ul>
      <li> Generate HTML code - class: <i> WWW </i> - 75% complete to HTML 1.0
      <li> Data container - class: <i> item </i> - stores key value pairs
      <li> Form object - class: <i> formobj </i> - programatic presentation
           of form
      <li> Abstract class: <i> session </i> - tracks cronology, manages 
           <i> formobj </i>, <i> item </i>, etc.
   </ul>
   <li> Debugging
   <ul>
      <li> a simple class that overrides printing - very primative
      <li> using a file tracer - dump messages to a file
      <li> bypassing the web server - call a script that dumps 
           the calling parameters instead of calling you script
   </ul>
   <li> Future issues
   <ul>
      <li> Overcoming 23.5Kb limit in forms
      <li> HTML standard for menus and pop-up menues
      <li> ability to include files from the users system
      <li> easy interface to data encription in both directions
      <li> ability to include code libraries for data filtering and 
           validation written by the server maintainer into the browser
      <li> ability to provide simple data checking and validation
   </ul>

<h1>Creating HTML documents in python (Joel Shprentz)</h1>
<ul>
   <li> Quick Review of HTML
   <ul>
      <li> Start with Text
      <li> Add tags
   </ul>
   <li> Webs combine static and dynamic pages
   <li> HTML document tree
   <ul>
      <li> Python code to generate HTML...
      <pre>
	def createHtml (partyList):
	print "<H1>Hello World</H1>"
      </pre>
      <li> Problems
      <ul>
         <li> Bad HTML is not trapped right away
         <li> Knowledge is not reusable
         <li> Document is generated in a strict sequence
         <li> Hard to change document style among many documents
      </ul>
      <li> A better way: use HTML documents structure as a paradigm for
           code (as a tree)
   </ul>
   <li> Object Model
   <ul>
      <li> Each tag is modeled as an object
      <li> Object attributes
      <ul>
         <li> Tag: string, Attributes: dictionary
      </ul>
      <li> Object methods
      <ul>
         <li> append, prepend, setAttribute, writeHTML
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <li> Some simple python code...
   <pre>
   	body = HtmlElement("BODY")
   	head = HtmlElement("H1")
   	image = HtmlElement("IMG")
   	body.writeStdout()
   </pre>
   <li> Improvement: Use a tag factory to create all tag object
   <ul>
      <li> tag factory knows correct HTML syntax
      <li> tag factory sets the most used attibutes
   </ul>
   <li> Python code with tag factory...
   <pre>
	image = Tag.IMG("flag.gif")
    	head = Tag.H1 ([image, " Politics"])
  	body = Tag.BODY(head)
	body.writeStdout()
   </pre>
   <li> Code can be nested
   <li> HTML forms
   <ul>
      <li> implemented as tags
      <li> a single field may have many tags
      <li> forms are <i> HtmlElement</i> tag objects
      <li> fields are special subclasses of <i> HtmlElement </i>
      <li> fields can set their values from a CGI response dictionary
   </ul>
   <li> HTML documents need consistent style
   <li> Abstract class <i> HtmlDocument </i>
   <ul>
      <li> contents, append, prepend, writeHtml
   </ul>
   <li> 
   <li> Python library
   <ul>
      <li> <i> htmlDoc </i>
      <li> 628 lines of python, 16 classes
      <li> available from <i> www.python.org </i>
   </ul>
   <li> Work In Progress
   <ul>
      <li> HTML Upgrades, currently 2.0
      <li> HTML Parsing - parse HTML into a tree of objects
      <li> SGML Support - could be extended to support
           (maybe code to generate a tag factory from a DTD)
   </ul>
   <li> Future Directions
   <ul>
      <li> Choose best way to store HTML text - pickles?
      <li> Provide a better forms model
      <ul>
         <li> Present form (possibly with preset responses)
         <li> validate input
         <li> process request
         <li> display results
      </ul>
      <li> paring down large lists into multiple selections
   </ul>
   <li> Conclusions
   <ul>
      <li> Python is excellent
      <li> HTML tag classes guarantee correct tags
      <li> Object tree matches tag structure
      <li> HTML document classes consolidate style decisions in one place
      <li> New HTML applications are small and easy to build
   </ul>
   <li>Q: (Scott Hassan) What about preserving asyncronous loading
       of pages?  Doesn't buffering the entire page up till the end
       break that?
   <li>A: Most of the delay is in network delays, not in processing
       the python
   <li>Q: (Scott) What about if your python does an SQL query?
   <li>A: Often I need to know how many hits I got to decide how to
       display the page
   <li>Q: (Scott) User needs to see *something* happening
   <li>A: Yes that would be nice too

<h3>SYLU 1.0 - ILU runtime reimplemented in/for Python (Scott Hassan)</h3>
<ul>
   <li> What is ILU
   <ul>
      <li> Invented at Xerox PARC
      <li> Distributed Objects
      <li> ISL (Interface Specification Language) - language independent 
           object specifier
      <li> Every parameter is strongly typed
      <li> Corba ORB (Object Request Broker)
      <li> language independent
      <li> transport independent (UDP, TCP, email)
   </ul>
   <li> SYLU
   <ul>
      <li> Scott's Yet another Language Unification
      <li> Just the Python/ILU runtime reimlemented
      <li> Under 4000 lines of code
      <li> doesn't implement entire ILU 1.X - no courier protocol,
           no singleton types, no garbage collection, no UDP 
      <li> Future
      <ul>
         <li> ILU 2.0 support
         <li> thread support for big time server programs
         <li> support encryption that ILU supports (SSL, others)
      </ul>
      <li> Grail applications that use SYLU
      <ul>
         <li> Chat room
         <li> Drawing room - everyone draws on the same page
         <li> Four player Roulette game
         <li> <i> http://www-db.standford.edu/~hassan/grailApps</i>
      </ul>
      <li> Performance - ILU will be faster than raw HTTP because
           the connection stays open (adds 25% overhead to raw TCP)
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Security == Authentication == Encryption (Aaron Watters - Bell Labs)</h3>
<ul>
   <li> Sun is right - the network *is* the computer
   <ul>
      <li> Machine boundries are the most irritating
   </ul>
   <li> Sun is wrong - Java style security isn't enough
   <ul>
      <li> too complicated 
      <li> requires bug free interpreter
      <li> java specific
      <li> one level of security
   </ul>
   <li> Netscape is right
   <ul>
      <li> Encryption protocols provide trustworthy security (e.g. SSL)
      <li> Simple
      <li> If the application has bugs it won't work *but* the priviledged
           access will be maintained
      <li> not specific to one language, os, hardware, chip, etc.
      <li> Fully and easily configurable
   </ul>
   <li> Goal - define a protocol which provides...
   <ul>
      <li> configurable authorization
      <li> configurable security
   </ul>
   <li> Constraints
   <ul>
      <li> don't want to know where the code is running
   </ul>
   <li> Proposal: encryption protected pseudo secure cell OS
   <li> Q: Are we talking about two security issues 1) privacy
        2) trojan horse?
   <li> Secure Key distribution is still a major problem
</ul>
