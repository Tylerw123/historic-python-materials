<H2>Accomodation for the <A HREF="./">3rd Python Workshop</A></H2>

<P>[Adapted from a message by <A
HREF="mailto:mclay@eeel.nist.gov">Michael McLay</A> on the subject.]

<P>I did a quick WWW search and found a page listing some of the <A
HREF="http://www.digex.net/herndon/hotel.html">hotels in Reston
area</A>.  Since it sounds like you are looking for something at
the lower end of the cost spectrum I've checked with two of the hotels
which generally have moderate rates.

<PRE>Comfort Inn - Herndon Dulles
200 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 22070, (703) 437-7555
	$72/night +tax		standard  (for an individual)
	$70.20/night +tax	w/ AAA discount
	$59/night +tax  	corporate rate (Just need to give your
						corporation's name)</PRE>

Comfort Inn are in the low-end, no-frills chain motels category.  They
are much better than the bottom of the line Motel 6 chain, but the
quality of rooms tend to vary a bit.

<PRE>Holiday Inn Express
485 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 22070, (703) 478-9777

	$79/night +tax		standard 
	$69/night +tax		corporate rate</PRE>

Holiday Inn Express's is a new chain from the old company.  They are
targeting the same market that was pioneered by Marriott Courtyard,
business travelers who don't want any surprises.  The Express 
rooms are very nice, comfortable, and spacious.  Rooms with a single
bed include a desk, comfy chair, microwave, and frig.  I think the
rooms with two beds don't have the comfy chair.  The one I stayed at
in Menlo Park included breakfast They have an exercise room, but do
not have a restaurant or a pool.  It's a good value at $69 for the
Reston/Herndon area.

<P>The meeting is in suburbia so you'll probably want a rental car.

<P>This may be an opportunity to do some touring of the Washington, DC area.
Early December's weather can be nice, but it can also be cold and
rainy.  Anyway since all the museums are free spending a couple days
at the Smithsonian could be a very inexpensive vacation to tag on to
the trip.  The metro takes you right down to the Mall so you don't
need a car if you stay at one of the hotels at a metro stop in the
suburbs.
