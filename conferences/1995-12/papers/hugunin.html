<h2>Yet Another Numeric Language?</h2>
<p>
There are a huge collection of existing numeric programming languages, both  
commercial (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlab.html">Matlab</a>,  
S-PLUS, <a  
href="http://sslab.colorado.edu:2222/projects/IDL/idl_ssl_home.html">  
IDL</a>) and free (<a href="http://bevo.che.wisc.edu/octave.html">  
Octave</a>, <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~ians/rlab.html"> RLaB</a>, <a  
href="ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/html/yorick_toc.html"> Yorick </a>,  
<a href="http://www-phys.llnl.gov/X_Div/htdocs/basis.html"> BASIS </a>, <a  
href="http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/gnudl-doc/gnudl_toc.html"> Gnudl  
</a>, ...).  Why on earth would I want to go out and create a new one?

<p>
I've used almost all of the available numerical languages at one time or  
another over the past 8 years.  One thing I've noticed is that over time,  
the designers of these languages are steadily adding more of the features  
that one would expect to find in a general-purpose programming language.

<p>
<em>"Octave has a real mechanism for handling functions that take an  
unspecified number of arguments, so it is no longer necessary to place
an upper bound on the number of optional arguments that a function can
accept." </em> <a  
href="http://www.che.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(octave-faq)Variable-length%20argument%20lists">  
Octave FAQ </a>
<p>
<em>"However, the most significant improvement is RLaB's list class. A list  
is a heterogeneous associative array that can contain any data type,  
including other lists. The list gives RLaB users the opportunity to  
structure their data as necessary." </em> <a  
href="http://www.eskimo.com/~ians/rlab-why/node2.html"> Why Use RLaB?</a>
<p>
<em> "The eval function now provides an optional mechanism for detecting  
and trapping error conditions that occur during the evaluation of the  
argument expression." </em> <a  
href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlab.html">Matlab 4.1 Release Notes</a>
<p>
<em> "S-PLUS now supports a number of features from the object-oriented  
programming paradigm, including classes, inheritance, and methods." </em>  
S-Plus 3.0 Release Notes
<p>
By starting with the <a href="http://www.python.org/"> Python </a>  
programming language as a base, I already have functions with optional  
arguments (and keyword arguments), heterogeneous lists (and dictionaries), a  
powerful exception system for evals (and everywhere else), and a strong  
object system that was built into the language from the start; all in a  
robust, well-designed and portable implementation (thanks Guido!).  Rather  
than trying to retrofit an existing numerical language to support the wealth  
of features found in a powerful, modern, general-purpose programming  
language, it makes much more sense to attack the problem from the other  
direction and add the features of a powerful numerical programming language  
to <a href="http://www.python.org/"> Python</a>.

<p>
These issues are important even if the only use for this language is to be  
a numeric lab.  However, they become overwhelming if you want to build  
applications that contain a blend of numeric and more traditional  
computational needs.  I've been implementing a speech recognition system  
completely within my matrix extended version of python.  This task would be  
nearly impossible in any other numerical language.  I'm making extensive use  
of the sophisticated object and module system of python, as well as its  
ability to handle sockets, audio i/o, general purpose UI's, etc.

<h2>Design Goals</h2>

<h3>Easily Extensible with FORTRAN and C libraries</h3>

This object is based on an original implementation by <a  
href="http://www.python.org/workshops/1995-05/extModulesNotes.html"> Jim  
Fulton</a>.  His basic design already interfaced nicely with existing  
libraries, and I just had to be careful not to break anything.

<h3>Close to the Speed of Optimized C for Vector Operations</h3>

Testing the system on a Sparc-10 by multiplying a 10000 length vector by  
itself 1000 times, I found that the python implementation was 20% slower  
than fully optimized (-O4) hand-coded C.  When compared to existing  
numerical languages, I found the python system to be 30% faster than matlab  
(70% faster if I only need "float" precision), and 1000% faster than octave.

<h3>All Array Operators Supported</h3>

All of the basic numeric operators are supported element-wise for matrices.  
 In addition, the basic array comparison and logical operators are provided  
as methods (because these operators can't be overloaded within python).   
The jury is still out as to how best to implement matrix multiplication.   
The two likeliest possibilities are as a method (ie. a.matrixMultiply(b)) or  
by replacing the modulo operator (ie. a % b).

<h3>Arbitrarily High-Dimensional Arrays</h3>

Many existing numerical languages only support two-dimensional arrays.   
This sort of arbitrary restriction is ridiculous in the current era of  
modern programming languages and practice.  The matrix object was designed  
from the ground up to support arrays of arbitrary dimensions.

<h3>Powerful Generalized Product Form Indexing</h3>

Mapping semantics are used to support multi-dimensional product form  
indexing for matrix objects.  Multi-dimensional indices are a sequence of  
python objects, where the first object corresponds to the first dimension of  
the matrix, and so on.  If there are fewer objects in the sequence than  
dimensions in the matrix, each remaining dimension is selected in it's  
entirety.  The following objects are possible for each dimension:

<ul>
<li>A single integer, indicating one element from that dimension and a  
reduction in the number of dimensions in the returned matrix.
<li>A sequence of integers, not necessarily unique, selecting an arbitrary  
collection of elements along that dimension
<li>A slice object which selects a range of elements along the dimension  
with optional start index, stop index and step size.
</ul>

<h3>Function Objects for Flexibility</h3>

Every arithmetic operator is implemented as a special ofunc object within  
python.  These functions can be called with matrix or scalar arguments to  
return the normal result.  In addition, these functions can be subscripted  
to indicate that they should be applied at a specific rank, and they can be  
modified to indicate that instead of a direct product, they should be  
applied as a generalized outer, or inner product, or as a reduction or  
accumulation.

<h3>Full Range of Primitive Data Types</h3>

The matrix object supports arrays of chars, bytes, shorts, ints, longs,  
floats, doubles, complex floats, complex doubles, and raw python objects.   
This is essential to allow interfacing with the full range of existing  
numerical libraries.  I know of no other numerical language that supports  
such a complete collection of data types.

<h3> No Changes to the Python Core Required </h3>

I was shocked at how much of this system could be elegantly implemented by  
designing two new object types (one for matrices, and one for functions on  
matrices) and a module.  Nevertheless, this effort did suggest two  
relatively small patches to the python core to make numeric operations more  
convenient, and these have been implemented by Konrad Hinsen.  These include  
a**b <--> pow(a,b) and a[2,3,4] <--> a[(2,3,4)].  Both of these additions  
have already received Guido's preliminary sanction.

<h2> Current Status </h2>

All of the original design goals have been met.  The matrix object is  
currently in its second alpha release, and there have been minimal reported  
bugs.

Current work includes:

<ul>
<li>Implementing linear-algebra style multiplication properly
<li>Supporting sparse matrices
<li>Cleaning up printing and string representations of matrices
<li>Extending PyArgs_ParseTuple to handle matrices
<li>Experimenting with Yorick style indexing
<li>General cleanup and bug squashing
</ul>

<h2> Acknowledgements </h2>

The initial structure of the matrix object was created by Jim Fulton.  Many  
of the ideas in this object are stolen from the members of the python  
matrix-sig.  In particular, Konrad Hinsen, Paul Dubois, Chris Chase, Thomas  
Schwaller, Tser-Yuan Ya, David Ascher, Dong Gweon Oh, and of course, Guido  
van Rossum (I'm sure that I'm missing people here) have been filled with  
good ideas.  I still would have made this object without any of them, but it  
wouldn't be nearly so well designed.
