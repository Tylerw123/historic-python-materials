<H2>Abstract</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A group of Python classes model HTML formatted documents and their contents.
Mimicking the hierarchical structure of HTML tags, content objects form a
treelike representation of an HTML document. A tag factory object creates each
node in the tree, typically a tagged element, which may include attributes and
initial contents. Additional contents--text and other tags--can be added later.
The HtmlDocument class provides an overall structure for HTML documents.
Application-specific subclasses override default methods that create the start,
body, and end of a document. Often a complete HTML document can be created by
instantiating an HtmlDocument subclass with a few parameterized values, such as
document title. When a document is completely built, it can be written to any
output stream, such as a file, pipe, or socket. Individual tags can also be
written to output streams. The HTML classes provide more functionality
and greater reusability than the simple Python output statements often used.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<P>A common problem at World Wide Web sites is the automatic creation of HTML
documents. Whether the documents are created on the fly by a CGI script or in
advance by a batch production system, the most common approach is to execute a
sequence of print statements that create the HTML document one line at a time.
This strategy works with any programming language. For example, here is a Unix
shell script to generate a simple HTML document.<p>
<pre>    #!/bin/sh
    echo '&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;'
    echo '&lt;TITLE&gt;Hello World&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;'
    echo '&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Hello World&lt;/H1&gt;'
    echo '&lt;P&gt;Program with'
    echo '&lt;A HREF="http://www.python.org/"'
    echo '&gt;Python&lt;/A&gt; today&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;'</pre>
<p>In actual documents, the body is created based on some calculation,
model, or information retrieval, often in response to user input. As the
complexity of the documents grows, programmers migrate from simple scripting
languages to more complex interpreted languages, like TCL and Perl, and then to
compiled languages, like C. Object oriented languages are also available:
interpreted languages like Python and compiled languages like C++.<p>
The interpreted Python language<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> combines the
benefits of object oriented development with the rapid application development
environment of interpreted languages. The Python class
library<a href="#fn2">[2]</a> contains a
rich collection of tools including an HTML parser and a CGI interface, but it
does not include any classes for constructing HTML documents. Thus, despite all
of Pythons capabilities, the Python program to generate a simple HTML document
is almost identical to the shell script:
<pre>    print '&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;'
    print '&lt;TITLE&gt;Hello World&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;'
    print '&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Hello World&lt;/H1&gt;'
    print '&lt;P&gt;Program with'
    print '&lt;A HREF="http://www.python.org/"'
    print '&gt;Python&lt;/A&gt; today&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;'</pre><p>
There are several potential problems with this approach:
<UL><LI><i>The HTML may be incorrect.</i> Tag and attribute names may be
mistyped. Closing tags may be misplaced or omitted. Nested tags, like list
elements, may be improperly structured.
<LI><i>The software is not reusable.</i> The only way to reuse part of a
program like this is to copy the code with a text editor.
<LI><i>The HTML document is generated in sequential order.</i> This
precludes placing summary information at the top or varying the presentation
based on content. It is also hard to recover from processing errors.</UL>
<h2><a name="RTFToC3">2. HTML Document Structure</a></h2>
<P>The tagged text elements of HTML<a href="#fn3">[3]</A> documents are
organized in a treelike structure, with each tag potentially containing text
intermingled with one or more other tags. The tags in the example document have
this tree structure:<p>
<A HREF="tree.gif"><IMG SRC="tree.gif" width=180 height=200
ALT="tree structure of HTML document"></A>
<H3><A NAME="Sec1">2.1 HTML Objects</A></H3><p>
This tree structured hierarchy is similar to the composite
pattern<a href="#fn4">[4]</A> from
object oriented design. Following this pattern, an abstract class,
HtmlContents, declares common operations, most notably writeHtml, which writes
the HTML contents to a file. Subclasses of HtmlContents implement these
operations for specific types of HTML document contents: tags, text, and space.
Tag objects, called HtmlElement, implement additional methods to modify
contents and attributes. Preformatted elements, like the &lt;PRE&gt; tag, are
represented by a subclass of HtmlElement. The object structure is shown below
in Coad notation<a href="#fn5">[5]</A>:<p>
<A HREF="diag.gif"><IMG SRC="diagtiny.gif" ALT="object model diagram"
WIDTH=235 HEIGHT=220></A><p>
There are many tags in the HTML 2.0 specification, so another class,
HtmlTagFactory, defines methods to create a valid HtmlElement object for each
possible tag. As HTML evolves, the HtmlTagFactory class can be extended and
revised to accommodate new tags. There is only one instance of HtmlTagFactory.
It is named Tag.<p>
HtmlElement objects can be created with or without initial contents. The
initial contents can be text, HtmlElement objects, or lists. List elements can
also be text, HtmlElement objects, or lists. For example,
<pre>    document = Tag.HTML ()
    docTitle = Tag.TITLE ("Sample document")
    docHead = Tag.HEAD (docTitle)
    docBody = Tag.BODY ([Tag.P ("Some text), Tag.P ("More text")])</pre><p>
The same text, HtmlElement objects, and lists can be appended or
prepended to any HtmlElement objects.  For example, to complete the sample
document,
<pre>    document.append ([docHead, docBody])</pre><p>
This capability is often used within a loop to construct a list. For
example, this code constructs an ordered list of words:
<pre>    words = ["red", "yellow", "green", "blue", "orange"]
    wordList = Tag.OL ()
    for word in words:
        wordList.append (Tag.LI (word))</pre><p>
Many HTML tags have attributes. These can be specified when the
HtmlElement object is created or set later. An anchor tag with an HREF
attribute would look like this:
<pre>    Tag.A ("click here", "http://www.python.org/")</pre><p>
Forms and form fields are other types of HTML tags. As HTML is
defined, there are many variations of INPUT tag (text, check boxes, etc.). Each
variation of the INPUT tag is implemented by a different subclass of
HtmlElement. The tag factory understands all of these forms. For example, to
create a text field to hold a 5-digit zipcode with no default value,
<pre>    Tag.inputText (None, "zipcode", 5, 5)</pre><p>
Form field objects have a unique capability: When the value dictionary
returned by Python's CGI class is passed to a tag tree, each form field in the
tree will lookup its value in that dictionary and use the value when generating
the HTML document. This makes it easy to preset a form based on a user's
responses.<p>
All subclasses of HtmlContents respond to the writeHtml method by writing their
HTML representation to a specified file. The sample document created above
could be written to standard output as follows:
<pre>    from sys import stdout
    document.writeHtml (stdout)</pre>

<H3><A NAME="Sec2">2.2 Nonsequential Construction</A></H3>
<P>The various tag objects support nonsequential construction of
HTML documents. This is essential when related information is distributed
throughout a document. For example, a table of contents at the beginning
of the document should list only the sections actually included in that document.
The "print a statement at a time" strategy cannot easily create such documents.
Consider this pseudocode for a document:
</P><PRE><I>    print heading
    print table of contents
    if condition 1 then print section 1
    if condition 2 then print section 2
    print footing</I></PRE>
<P>When the table of contents is being printed, this code has not yet
evaluated the conditions nor decided which sections to include. The
conditions are often of the form, "did the query return any results," so
it is inconvenient to evaluate them except when printing the section based
on the query results. A possible solution is to first print the sections to
a temporary file and then merge that file into the final file.</P><P>
Tag objects offer a better solution. The tag hierarchy need not be created
sequentially, but can be augmented as needed. The sectioned document can be
created with this pseudocode:
</P><PRE><I>    body = Tag.BODY ()
    body.append (heading)
    toc = table of contents
    body.append (toc) 
    if condition 1 then
        toc.append ("Section 1")
        body.append (Section 1) 
    if condition 2 then
        toc.append ("Section 2")
        body.append (Section 2) 
    body.append (footing)</I></PRE>
<P>Each section adds its own entry to the table of contents, which is already
correctly positioned in the document. Similar techniques can be used to place
summary information near the front of a document (e. g., average values or
counts of search results).</P>
<P>This technique for document construction is possible because
today's computer
memories are guaranteed to be large enough to hold the tree representation of
an HTML document. It is more effective to manipulate the entire document in
memory then to repeatedly process and output small amounts of information.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Sec3">2.3 Writing HTML Output</A></H3><p>
The HTML output includes all tags and attributes, replaces special
characters (e.g., &amp;) with their HTML representation, suppresses redundant
spaces, breaks text into lines of about 70 characters, and adds line breaks
after major tags (e.g., H1 and P). Some of these steps require tracking the
capacity and spacing status of each output line, a capability not present in
Python's file class. Although the tracking features could be implemented by
subclassing the file class, this would preclude using sockets and other
file-like objects.<p>
The implementation chosen relies on HtmlFile, a wrapper class for Python files.
HtmlFile tracks spacing, character count, newlines, and preformatted text for a
given file. The two principal public methods are write (for text) and writeAsIs
(for tags and attribute values). HtmlFile makes the implementation of writeHtml
trivial in the HtmlContents class:
<pre>    def writeHtml (self, outfile)
        self.writeToHtml (HtmlFile (outfile))</pre><p>
Each subclass of HtmlContents must implement writeToHtml. The HtmlText
objects convert special characters before writing the text:
<pre>    def writeToHtml (self, outfile)
        pieces = splitfields (self.text, "&amp;")
        outText = joinfields (pieces, "&amp;amp;")
        . . .
        outfile.write (outText)</pre><p>
The HtmlElement objects must write a starting tag, which might include
attributes; the contents, which are found on a list containing text and other
elements; an optional ending tag; and an optional line break. Here is the
definition:
<pre>    def writeToHtml (self, outfile)
        self.writeStartTag (outfile)
        self.writeContents (outfile)
        if self.needEndTag:
            outfile.write ("&lt;/%s&gt;" % self.tag)
        if self.tagEndsLine:
            outfile.writeNewline ()</pre>
<h2><a name="RTFToC4">3. HTML Documents</a></h2>
<p>A typical web application will contain several types of pages, each produced by
a different program. Examples include query forms, result pages, and indices.
Graphic designers<a href="#fn6">[6]</a> recommend that these pages
share common design elements, such as logos, banners, feedback links,
modification date, and navigation aids. These common elements typically appear
at the top and bottom of each page.<p>
An abstract class, HtmlDocument, provides a framework for implementing
documents with common design elements. HtmlDocument is similar to HtmlElement
in that it responds to append and prepend methods to add elements to the
document body. It also responds to writeHtml to write to a file and printHtml
to write to standard output. However, when implementing writeHtml, HtmlDocument
will call three methods to create common design elements: head, startBody, and
endBody.<p>
A web application will implement head, startBody, and endBody in a subclass of
HtmlDocument.
<pre>    class SampleHtmlDocument (HtmlDocument):</pre><p>
Consider a page design for a typical application. At the top of each
page, there is a banner logo, then a title and subtitle. The SampleHtmlDocument
startBody method could look like this:
<pre>    def startBody (self):
        return [self.banner (), self.pageTitles ()]</pre><p>
The two methods used to construct the list must also be defined. This
method builds the page titles.
<pre>    def pageTitles (self):
        titles = []
        if self.title:
            titles.append (Tag.H1 (self.title))
        if self.subtitle:
            titles.append (Tag.H2 (self.subtitle))
        titles.append (Tag.HR ())
        return titles</pre><p>
Once the basic page design is established for an application, other
subclasses can add additional design elements required by particular page
types, such as query forms.<p>
There are some advantages to this approach:
<UL><LI>All pages have the same design look.
<LI>The design can be changed in a single source file.
<LI>Programmers can focus their attention on the document body.</UL>
<h2><a name="RTFToC5">4. Conclusions</a></h2><p>
The code and design described have been used on several recent internal
projects. Earlier projects were implemented with the sequential print method
described in the introduction.<p>
The first improvement noticed was that the HTML produced is correct. There were
no missing tags or improperly nested elements. These errors are now unlikely to
occur because the document structure is reflected in the Python code and
because the HTML output is generated by well tested code. <p>
Sharing a common page design among several applications has been a great
benefit. With the print statement method, a design change required
modifications to each program that produced a different type of page. With the
object-oriented approach, only one file needs to be changed.<p>
Programmers no longer work at the raw HTML level. Instead, they treat HTML
document bodies as trees of tags. These HTML element, tag, and document classes
match the level of abstraction provided by many other classes in the Python
library.<p>
