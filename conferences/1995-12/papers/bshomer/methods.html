<H2>Service classes.</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <H3>web</H3>
	web is defined as a basic class which provides an easy interface
	to generating HTML primitives. The various HTML primitives are
	defined as methods of this class. Some of the primitives are very
	simple, e.g. for invoking headers, anchors, figures and ordered or
	unordered lists. Other methods perform somewhat more complex
	invocation of form elements, e.g. predefined buttons, radio
	buttons, checkboxes, data input fields and option lists 
	(See <A HREF = "figure1.html">figure 1</A>).
	
	
<LI> <H3>valids</H3>
	valids is a general service object holding methods
	that validate a given piece of information and returns a validity
	code (i.e. 0 for non-valid and >= 1 for valid) (See 
	<A HREF = "figure2.html">figure 2</A>). This class can be
	used directly by invokation or as part of a multiple inheritance
	invokation. The methods provide checking of information in various
	levels of complexity. Some of the methods provide simple checks
	such as ensuring that the information is safe and there is no
	attempt to invoke a shell with the text entered, or ensuring that
	an entry is only text or only numeric. Other
	methods perform more specific tasks (e.g. ensuring an entry is a
	valid nucleic acid sequence entry) or more complex (e.g. checking
	the syntax of an email address and assuring that the domain
	provided is a valid one)

<H2>GFOD</H2>
<STRONG>GFOD stands for Generic Forms Object Definition. It is a collection of the basic
classes with their data fields and methods that together form the basis for a data submission
process and to inheriting instances.</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI> <H3>item</H3>

	This is the basic unit for implementation of any information item
	to be obtained from the submitter. The basic elements of any item
	class are the 'key' and the 'value'.  Various data fields provide
	the item with characteristics that control it's visual
	implementation in the form. An item class has the basic methods
	which control it's validation and ability to report itself as
	valid, the ability to store it's elements in a file (given the
	open file handle). The item has an empty errors list. In case of a
	failed validation, the error list is filled with the error
	messages and is presented together with he item. The item has
	three different presentation methods. When the item is presented
	for the first time, or is non-valid, it is being presented in the
	form as defined in it's 'present' method. When the item is valid
	it uses the method 'present_hidden' to present itself in the form
	as a hidden element. This is one concept of data hiding which is
	practiced here, i.e. a valid data item should not be presented any
	further in the form. The third method controls the way an item
	present's itself in a special 'final validation' form (to be
	discussed later). The actual implementations of the system use
	classes that inherit 'item' and suit it for more specific needs.
	Examples for such elements (See <A HREF = "figure3.html">
	figure 3</A>) may be a hidden_item (allways valid, so allways
	hidden), an email item, a radio cluster item that provides a
	cluster of radion buttons for the same data field, an option list
	item, items for mandatory text or numeric items etc.
	
<LI> <H3>form_obj</H3>

	Each form in the sequence of submissions (Besides the form which
	initiates the submission process and two specialized forms that
	conclude the submission process) is an instance of a 'form_obj'
	class. The form_obj owns and controls a list of 'item'  objects.
	Each form_obj with it's items constitutes an integral entity in
	the submission sequence. The form object has a special data
	dictionary that maps the items. If the form_obj instance is
	initiated with a data dictionary, it's items are initiated as
	having the appropriate values (e.g. when restoring the form
	contents from a file), otherwise, the form items are initiated
	with their default values. Each form is identified by a 'level'
	data field which is actually it's linear order in the  sequence of
	forms of the whole submission process.<BR>

	The form_obj class is equipped with methods that enable it to
	store and retreive it's information to/from a temporary file. This
	is important especially due to the fact that personal systems
	and even more, WWW browsers are highly prone to crashing. The
	form_obj validation process is a more complex one, controlled
	three methods. The 'validate' method calls each of the items to
	report their valid status. If any of the items is non-valid, the
	form_obj is set to non-valid. Control is then handed over to a
	virtual method more_validate. This empty method provides
	inheriting classes with the opportunity to practice an extra step
	of validation according to logical relations between various
	items. To conclude, if the form_obj status is valid, the 
	finally_validate method returns control to the calling object (the
	session), but if the status is non-valid, the method takes control
	and invokes the presentation of the form.<BR>

	The form has two methods of presenting itself. The major one
	'present_form' invokes the presentation of a WWW form and then
	calls each 'item' instance's presentation  method to implant
	itself according to it's validity status (i.e. if the item is
	valid it is presented as hidden).  The other presentation method
	enables the form_obj to present it's data in the special step of
	final validation before concluding the submission.


<LI> <H3>session</H3>

	The whole submission process is owned and managed by the class
	'session'. This class owns a list of 'form_obj' instances to
	scroll through the submission process, calling each form in it's
	turn. The process, which can be invoked by many users at the same
	time is controlled with the aid of two identifiers. At the
	begining of the submission process, the submission is being
	assigned with a unique identifier which is implanted into each of
	the forms. Each of the form objects is identified in the sequence
	of submission by a 'level' which is actually it's position in the
	objects list. There are also special levels according to the stage
	of submission. The process which takes place for all the form_obj
	(or it's inheriting) instances is a simulation of an event loop.
	Initially, the form is set to non-valid and is displayed.
	Following submission, the 'session' object identifies the current
	level and accordingly calls the form's validation method. If the
	form is valid the session invokes the display of the next form in
	it's objects list. If the form is still non-valid, the form itself
	takes control and displays itself. This contradicts the common
	concept of an event handeling hierarchy, but is evidently a
	consequence of the fact that server processes 
	are killed every time a document is sent back to the client.<P>
	
	The session is equipped with an empty method called 
	'expand_dynamic'. This method is called (even as an empty one) in
	the appropriate places, to enable later implementations of a
	dynamic expansion of the form_obj list. Thus, a user can select
	adding more instances of a certain form_obj class according to the
	need. An inheriting class that needs a dynamic expansion of forms
	must encapsulate the expansion method in the 'expand_dynamic'
	method, so it can allways be called when needed.
	
	When the last form in the 'session' object list is reported back
	to be valid, the session invokes a special form for final
	validation of the information. This is done by calling the 
	'present_contents' method of each form. The resulting form has a
	checkbox associated with each 'form_obj' instance. This form
	produces a corrections list. When the form is submitted, it is
	identified with a special 'level'. If it provides a non-empty 
	corrections list, the session itterates again through the selected
	forms by setting them as non-valid thus forcing them to present
	themselves for corrections. When the corrections list is empty the
	session 'produce_output' method is called to produce the output of
	the submitted information. Following production of output, the
	user is allowed to select forms that contain data to be used again
	in a consecutive submission cycle. This is done by the session
	class, which has a 'repeat_forms' list of allowed levels to be
	repeated. After the user has selected the required form levels,
	the session dumps a virtual memory file which contains the
	appropriate key=value combinations for preservation of
	information. Now, on invokation of each 'form_obj' instance, the
	session will compose a data dictionary which is handed to the
	form's 'init' method. When such a dictionary is present, the form
	will invoke the 'item' instances with the appropriate values as
	default.
