<H2>Introduction</H2>

The EMBL outstation - the EBI, maintains one of the world's largest
databases of nucleic acid (gene) sequences. The information is provided by
research laboratories around the world. Each data record is very complex
and contains a large amount of information which accompanies the sequence.
Therefore, the process of submitting data to the database is very
demanding and complicated.<P>

Some of the common ways of providing information were by editing a text
based form , or using a dedicated program which runs on a personal
computer and interactively guides the submitter in the steps of submission
and as an end result, creates a formatted text file. The text file 
is then sent by email.  There are drawbacks to these methods. Editing a
text file is not interactive and there is no machine based proccess to
validate the completeness of data. The standalone program on the other
hand, requires re-writing of the code for each platform. It is also 
very difficult to keep the program up-to-date with the dynamically
developing database. These drawbacks led to a search for better ways of
interactive data collection.<P>

The recent development of WWW based data entry forms opened a door to an
excellent interface between providers and maintainers of information. WWW
forms have many advantages. They provide a uniform graphic user interface.
They are machine independent and they provide means for a constant, online
update and maintenance by the server administrator.<P>

HTML documents, and especially forms are lend themselves gracefully to
object oriented development. The fact that each element of an HTML
document is created by a standard primitive fits well with the concept of
objects. This is especially evident in form elements that have a "TYPE"
primitive in their tags.<P>

Processing of the data stream which is provided by a submitted WWW form is
done by a CGI script. When the data submission process is complicated and
involves many validation steps of field contents and many forms, a simple
script is not sufficient and a need for a high-level program arises. The
Python programming language is especially suitable for writing such
programs. Python's unique combined ability to serve as a fast scripting
language and at the same time as a high level object oriented development
language turns it into a very powerful development tool for WWW
development. <P>


This article describes a data submission system that has been developed by
the author at the EBI. The system is based on a collection of Python
objects which define the basic properties of the system and the basic
steps in the cycle of aquiring, validating and submitting information. The
objects are defined in a generic way which enables the same basic system
to cater different data collection schemes. The design of the system makes
it easy to support various concepts such as data hiding, dynamic creation
of forms, preservation of data items for later use and providing context
sensitive help. A data submission system for the EMBL database has been
released to the public in May 1995 and it has been operating successfuly
since then, providing more than 850 data entries so far.<P>
