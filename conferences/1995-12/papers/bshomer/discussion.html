<H2>Discussion.</H2>

In a modern world where information is produced and accumulated in very
high rates, it is important to device data collection mechanisms that will
be friendly and efficient, device independent, yet capable of filtering
out as many errors as possible and sort information according to
specifications before a human interpretation step is required. WWW clients
that support forms are a very powerful interface for collecting
information from users through the network. The advantages of the forms
system are many. The WWW browser provides an easy way of enjoying a
graphic user interface, while being absolutely machine independent, since
WWW browsers exist for all the common platforms. <P>

This article described an information submission system that operates
based on an httpd server and is written entirely in the Python programming
language. Python was found to be extremely suitable for the development of
WWW service programs. Python's unique combination of capabilities to perform as an
interactive interpreter, as a powerful scripting language and a high level object
oriented design tool provides a fast development tool for WWW associated
programs.<P>

The system was developed in the spirit of an object oriented program which follows
the event handling loop scheme. This was easily obtained by using Python's ability
to store pointers to objects in a dynamically linked list. Thus, each form
object holds a list of item objects which it uses to iterate while calling each
object's methods. In the same way, the session object holds a list of form objects,
itterated in the same fahsion.  Dictionaries that map data and that can be passed as
arguments for a method provide the ability to initialize the form objects with
default values that were provided by the user. <P>

A major limitation exists when developing
for WWW environments. The fact that the server's process is killed once an
information page is dismissed to the client breaks the continuous flow of the
program. Therefore, solutions must be deviced to resume the process after breaking. 
In the EBI information submission system, each form object dumps it's data
dictionary as a temporary file. This temporary file is to be used later to restore
the form object's data dictionary, resuming it's status to what it was when the
process was terminated.<P>

During the time of developing and running the system, several limitations of WWW
forms were characterized. Some of these limitations create severe problems when WWW
browsers are being used for performing more complicated and demanding tasks of
interfacing and exchange of information. One such typical problem occured while
constructing an options list for selecting of information regarding the species to
which the information relates. Since the possible list is very long and there is a
limitation of displaying a maximum of 28-30 options in a list. This is very limiting
since only the most popular species can be included in the options list. The rest
must be typed into an input field. This may lead to many errors. Species can be
grouped according to families, orders etc. This enables creating a nested options
list, that reduces the length of each list and even more, introduces a logical
structure into the array, reducing the risks of typing or other errors. Currently,
the HTML standard does not support the concept of nested options lists. Another
drawback is that transferring such a large nested list through the network requires
much net traffic, which reduces the system's efficiency. One possible solution to
this combined problem would be to write a special applet for the Grail browser. The
applet code will be capable of transferring a compressed list, possibly saving it on
the local disk for further uses (like the browser's caching for graphics) and to
present the nested list, implanting the selected value into the message. <P>
The data validation process is crucial. When the data submission process is
complicated and involves many steps, the submission of a form which contains an
error may be a frustrating step, especially when network load is high. If the
browser could check the entry for some logical delimiters (e.g. not-empty, numeric
contents and range etc.) much of the error filtering would be done even before the
information leaves the submitter's browser. This too, can be done by implanting
applets in a Grail client.<P>

Another common problem occurs when submitters have fairly large sequences to submit.
This creates a technical problem of cutting and pasting the sequence, which is prone
to errors. Also, there is a technical limit for most browsers to transfer more than
23Kb of information from a single window. A very efficient solution to both of these
problems would be the ability to attach a file with the submission. This is not
implanted yet in the browsers and it is probably another application that can be
implanted in the Grail system.<P>

The future developments will obviousely depend on the success in exporting binaries
of Grail for all the commonly available platforms and especially personal computers.
There is no doubt that the popularity the WWW browsers have gained was primarily due
to their availability for PC and Macintosh platforms.<P>

Python's usefullenes as a robust development tool for Internet applications is
undoubtful. It's flexibility in providing interactive programming and scripting
environment as well as a high level interface to object oriented design will
probably place it in the near future in a distinguished position among the most
popular Internet development tools.
