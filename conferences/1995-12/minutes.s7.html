<h1> Graphical User Interface SIG </h1>
<i> Session Chair: Jim Fulton </i>

<a name="review">
<h3> Review of the GUI Checklist </h3>
<li> What are essential characteristics of a python GUI?
<ul>
    <li> Barry: Programming model vs. Implementation
    <li> Portability (Multi platform) vs. Native Look and Feel
    <li> Barry: Three audiences
    <ul>
       <li> Ubiquitous API (Unix, Windows, MAC, etc)
       <li> People writing products (native L&F important)
       <li> API that Grail presents
       <ul>
          <li> Guido: a tie should go to Tkinter because of Grail
       </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> Presentations of GUI Alternative </h3>

<a name="tkinter">
<h4> Tkinter </h4>
<i> Guido van Rossum </i>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> What is Tkinter?
   <ul>
      <li> A collection of wrapper classes around Tk
      <ul>
         <li> No need to know or use TCL to write Tkinter apps
      </ul>
      <li> Provides access to nearly all Tk features
      <li> Fairly strict correspondence to Tk functionality
      <li> Python provides a nice object oriented model around Tk
   </ul>
   <li> TCL Example
   <pre>
    button .top.quit -text Quit -command exit
    pack .top.quit
   </pre>
   <li> Python Example
   <pre>>
    quit = Button(top, text='Quit', command=sys.exit)
    quit.pack()
   </pre>
   <li> Meta-Advantages of Tk
   <ul>
      <li> Tk has hundreds of thousands of users
      <li> Osterhout is motivated to support it
      <li> Good long term prospects
      <li> Large Tkinter user base in the Python community
      <li> Grail is written using Tkinter
   </ul>
   <li> Tk Portablity
   <ul>
      <li> Ports to Windows and MAC underway
      <ul>
         <li> Currently alpha quality
         <li> Will acquire native look and feel sometime in 96
         <li> User community expected to grow to millions
         <li> Assertion: If OLE is not present on the Windows
              port, Microsoft apps will be *very* limited
         <li> Response: Distributed object technologies are
              still too immature to attempt to standardize
              Just the GUI will be hard enough
         <li> Robin: Moving to native L&F wiil be very tough
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <li> Meta-Disadvantages of Tk
   <ul>
      <li> Sun "owns" Tcl and Tk - no control over development
      <li> Portability has yet to be demonstrated - currently
           some areas are too X11 specific
   </ul>
   <li> Technical Advantages of Tk
   <ul>
      <li> No redraw necessary - all redrawing handled by Tk!
      <li> Automatic geometry management
      <li> Multi-font text widget with embedded images
      <li> Canvas widget allows drawing objects, text, images
      <li> Comprehensive widget and option sets
      <li> Full X11 window manager interface
      <ul>
         <li> titles
         <li> icons
         <li> grabbing
         <li> transient windows
         <li> geometry, etc
      </ul>
      <li> Support for async I/O handlers, timers
   </ul>
   <li> Technical Disadvantages of Tk
   <ul>
      <li> Must link with TCL
      <li> passing all data though Tcl can be slow (strings only)
      <li> Sometimes TCL peculiarities show through (scroll bars)
      <li> Occasional bad choice of interface in Tkinter
      <ul>
         <li> <i> from Tkinter import * </i>
         <li> <i> w.config([text': "Hello World"]) # old
         <li> w.config(text="Hello World)      # new </i>
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <li> Suggestions for the Future
   <ul>
      <li> Continue to support Tkinter interface
      <li> phase out use of dictionaries (keyword parameters instead)
      <li> Improve performance using Rivet
      <ul>
         <li> avoids passing things via Tcl
         <li> performance closer to C
      </ul>
      <li> Migrate to an improved interface called <i> Tk </i>
      <ul>
         <li> <i> import Tk    b = Tk.Button()
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <li> Q: Does Tk have and interface simmilar to NetScape's 
        <i> plugin </i> ?
   <li> Guido, Barry: No, but it would be a very easy extension
        to the <i> TopLevel </i> function
   <li> Jim: Does Tk provide the right level of abstraction?
        For example can I actually add and delete things off the
        end of a *large* scrolling list? (e.g. I don't want it 
        all in memory?) 
   <li> Guido: Yes
   <li> Jim: Are the X11 fonts going to be used on the MAC and
        Windows ports?  
   <li> Guido: On the MAC there are a *few* that are the same
</ul>
<br>
<h4> Demo of bake-off app using Tk </h4>
<ul>
   <li> Written in Python by fortran programmer
        at USGS who had not used Tk or python before
   <li> USGS has alot of specific needs for plotting and 
        <i> sticking our tick marks everywhere </i> and
        cross-platform support is very important
   <li> His general impression was that Tk is very nice
        and python is very nice and easy to use
   <li> He used the python 1.2 (non-keyword arguments)
        and an older version of Tk 
   <li> program is 854 lines
</ul>

<a name="wpy">
<h4> WPY </h4>
<i> Jim Ahlstrom </i>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Portability
   <ul>
      <li> Linux, NT, 95, Windows 3.1 (sortof - with win32s)
      <li> NT port funs on Win95, Win3.1, LAF: Native
      <li> No port (yet) to MAC
      <li> Strong port to UNIX using Tk
   </ul>
   <li> Language
   <ul>
      <li> Python class library, high OO design
      <li> Python on UNIX/Tk, has C++ interface for NT port
      <li> No port for OS/2, but you can run it on OS/2
           using a win32s or a new OS/2 LAF windows
   </ul>
   <li> Documentation
   <ul>
      <li> 2000 lines of UNIX like documentation describes all
      <li> classes and methods.  Discussion of app creation and drawing
      <li> Can read wpy.py sources, has all classes and methods
   </ul>
   <li> Performance
   <ul>
      <li> under UNIX it uses tkinter -> TCL -> Tk
      <li> under Windows, it passes pretty quickly to C++
           layer which makes MFC calls
      <li> Good performance for both
      <li> Special C++ support for scrolling on NT (native on Tk)
   </ul>
   <li> Features
   <ul>
      <li> Document/View model class
      <li> under windows you get templates
      <li> Dialog classes (modal, modless)
      <li> Drawing classes, Brush, font, txt, line, circle, others
      <li> Images: gif, ppm, on all, bmp and dib on NT)
      <li> Control Classes: Push Button, Check Button, Radio Button
           (these check themselves on Tk, not MFC), Label, Message
      <li> Menus: Bar, Popup, cascading, popups
      <li> Geometry management is very different from Tk (MFC
           lacks geometry management)
      <li> WPY Geometry management is most like Tk <i> placer </i>
      <li> Geometry mangement is more like explicit placement, Controls
           have a default size, even the the GUI has not yet made the
           control
      <li> Footprint
      <ul>
         <li> On unix: uses stock build of Python 1.3 with Tk4.0 and
              tkinter.c Requires wpy.py (2300 lines), wpy_tk.py (1500
              lines) and wpycon.py (600 lines)
         <li> On NT requires Python 1.2 (soon 1.3) plus 12 C++ modules
	      with 6400 lines of C++, plus wpy.py, wpycon.py.
      </ul>
      <li> small code exerpts from the demo program (lot's of stuff
           omitted)
      <pre>
# Make some brushes to draw points
ignoreBrush = wpy.CBrush((127,127,127)).Create()
mainBrush = wpy.CBrush((127,127,0).Create()

# The View
class GraphView(wpy.CScrollView):
	def OnCreate(self, event):
	def OnSize(self, rect): # Initial size or resize of window
	def SetSelected(self, new): # Change the selected point
	def DrawGraph(self, DC): # draw the graph
	def OnDraw(self, DC): # Draw the view

# Create the app
app = GraphApp()
      </pre>
   </ul>
</ul>

<h4> Demo of WPY </h4>
<ul>
   <li> Written by Jim Ahlstrom 
   <li> Slicker app than the Tk app (drag and drop annotations)
   <li> WPY is based on <i> little </i> tkinter.c
   <li> code is 546 lines
   <li> Jim F: how would you do table widgets?
   <li> Jim A: first I'd have to find the table widget in MFC
        and figure out how it works, then do the same thing for Tk,
        next figure out the simmilarities and differences, make some
        design decisions, implement the wpy wrapper
   <li> Demo'd first under Solaris then under Windows 95
   <li> slight quirk under 95 where the cross-hairs are not redrawn
        upon damage from a drag operation of a point object until
        the drop
   <li> MFC has a <i> document-view </i> architecture where X11 is
        a <i> callback </i> architecture
   <li> WPY uses MFC as a high-level model but mapps it into Tk
        as a medium level model
   <li> Guido: How do you handle fonts?
   <li> Jim A: Fonts are a nightmare, on X you can assign a font attribute
        (e.g. a font string),
        on Windows, you can specify three <i> styles </i> (which boil
	down to helvetica, Coriour, and whatever) then a font style
        (bold , italic), and MFC makes the best choice.  MFC has the
        higher level model, so this is what WPY uses
   <li> Should you need a call that does not exist, you need to write 
        a C interface
   <li> If you do something that's not documented under WPY, you run the
        risk of doing something that's not portable
</ul>

<h4> PNET (HTML-based GUI) </h4>

<i> Jim's wpy demo app running inside the PNET browser </i>
<p>
<i> By: Tyler Brooks </i>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Implemented as a <i> plugin </i> module - netscape style
   <li> applet extension for wpy, except that it's more like grail
        <i> extensions </i> because there's no safety and downloading
        capabilities
   <li> have multiple Microsoft's reusable software model (OCX) based
        plugin's
   <li> have a python interpreter plugin
   <li> I want to extend the model to the GUI using wpy
   <li> motivation for using python is the cross platform capabilities
        of wpy... If just windows we're just the intended audience,
	I would go with straight MFC
</ul>

<h4> Demo of wxWindows </h4>
<i> Jim Fulton </i>
<p>
<li> Windows 95
<ul>
   <li> Spent a very little amount time over Thanksgiving
   <li> wxPython is not complete implementation of wxWindows
   <li> On windows 95, an open gives you a windows 3.1 dialog!
   <li> On UNIX you get a motif dialog
   <li> Jim F. assertion: wxWindows people have made alot of
        the same design decisions
        as Jim (WPY) has - MFC (for better or for worse)
   <li> Jim F. assertion: it's good to have some standard layout
        conventions MFC supports this heavily  (you get something
        the user is familiar with)
   <li> Create a dialog with no geometry management requirment
        (appears in the middle with default button placement etc.)
   <li> Documentation is fairly extensive and complete
   <li> Jim F. assertion: I have some minor complaints about the 
        implementation, but nothing major
   <li> 395 lines - without the regression module, so probably 
        close to Jim A:
</ul>
<li> Motif
<ul>
   <li> Help menu on the right instead of the left (as it should be)
   <li> seems to work the same...
   <li> Motif Look and Feel
</ul>
<br>
<a name="discussion">
<h3> Where to we go from here? </h3>
<ul>
   <li> Reminder, stress the common GUI
   <li> Robin Assertion: Doesn't think Tkinter is going to be able
        to fill the gap of the complex things he wants to do
   <li> Guido: MFC gives you more abstraction than Tk (e.g. Most
        applications have a menu bar, a scrollbar) which you don't
        really need in Grail
   <li> Roger Assertion: I don't completely agree, I can forsee many
        applications that create there own menus and there own TopLevel
        windows, etc.
   <li> Assertion: last workshop we began this debate without the notion
        of grail or applets
   <li> A: problem is now applets are here and need to be addressed
   <li> Jim F: What about the technical developer who's not a computer 
        scientist?  All these API's are probably fine, but native L&F
        is probably very import
   <li> Ken: Two big issues 1) simplicity 2) native L&F
   <li> Tyler: let me add a third... applets
   <li> Jim A: Is anyone else worried about TK under windows?
   <li> Guido: Tk is there, it's tkinter that's not
   <li> Michael: Simplicity is key
   <li> Jim A: I don't believe that Osterhout's stuff runs under windows
   <li> Guido: I belive that <i> timing </i> needs to be added to the list
        of important things
   <li> Tyler: As a MFC programmer I found the wpy learning curve to be zero
        and if the windows audience is one you want, you may want to
        consider that
   <li> Assertion (Kurt?): What we need os a standard, powerful, cross-platform,
        object model for a GUI interface with native look and feel,
        NeXT OPENSTEP is that model.
   <li> Roger: I love OPENSTEP, but I also feel the timing is still early
        for it
   <li> Kurt: The API *is* the most important thing, choose the most
        elegant, powerful API
   <li> Guido:  Mark Lutz's book has a chapter on tkinter
   <li> Does that mean it's a defacto standard?
   <li> No, but it helps push it out
   <li> Jim F: Tk *is* the defacto standard... but not in the windows
        community
   <li> Guido: python is more like basic than like C++, so it needs to 
        be simple
   <li> Robin: wxwindow and tkinter's API's are very close, wxWindows
        is just more evolved
   <li> The concern is that Tk is not going to be ported well enough
        to Windows... otherwise we would not be here, we would already 
        have chosen Tk... so the windows crowd want to go with something
	that's more proven
   <li> Jim F: We have seen two tools today that can do both
   <li> Assertion: Power users are the audience (e.g. from NASA and USGS)
   <li> Jim F: one thing that makes wpy more attractive is the configuration
        management issue.
   <li> Guido: the same argument works for tkinter
   <li> Robin: as a common tool wxWindows is the *heavyest* of the choices
        but to me that's necessary to get close enough to the native kits
   <li> Guido: we have different user populations, and depending on whom
        you focus you come up with a different choice
   <li> Tyler: In my area, footprint is important (web situation)
   <li> Jim: It seems like there is a tie between wpy and Tk
        so let's include wpy and tkinter in the python standard distribution
   <li> Roger: I like Jim's idea, let's give wpy a chance to compete with
        tkinter, and in six months we'll have a much better idea that
        tk is going to be acceptable on Windows and the MAC.  We'll
   	rediscuss at the next meeting in six months. :-)
