<H2>Agenda for the first Python GUI SIG meeting </H2>

<UL>
<H4>The GUI SIG meeting isn't a part of the Workshop proper.  The goal of
the meeting is to work towards a common (not standard) Python interface for GUI
programming.  Everyone is invited to join in on the meeting, but it
will probably only be of interest to the developers of GUI modules.</H4>
</UL>
The meeting will <STRONG>not</STRONG> be held at USGS.
<P>
<STRONG>Location:</STRONG> At CNRI, 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, Va, in
the big conference room.

<H3>9:00-3:00 on 7 December 1995</H3>
<Strong>SIG Chair:</Strong> Jim Fulton

<DT>10:50-12:00, 1:00- 2:30
<DD>Presentations of GUI alternatives

     These presentations should include an overview of the GUI and
     a presentation of a sample application, preferably the simple
     regression application.  I know we'll have presentations for:

     <UL>
          <LI> Tkinter,
	  <LI><A href="./ahlstrom2.html">Status of WPY, a portable GUI module for Python</A><BR> 
          <LI> wxWindows, and
          <LI> PNET (HTML-based GUI)
     </UL>

     Any others?<P>

     It looks like we will have 30-45 minutes to spend for each
     alternative.  I'd be very happy to see other alternatives
     presented.

<DT>12:00- 1:00
