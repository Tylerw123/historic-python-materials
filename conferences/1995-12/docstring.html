<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copy=
right Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von=
 Tetzchner.  -->An obvious application of doc strings is the generation
of user documentation in "printed" form and in browsers.<p>
I have been able to (easily) automatically generate user documentation
from doc strings.<p>
Now that we have some experience using doc strings, is there anything that
can be done to make them more useful?<p>
<H2><A NAME=3D"HDR0">1.  doc_collect, by Daniel Larsson</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>Reads Python modules and generates manual pages in a variety of formats.<BR>

<LI>class or def statements become headings, with doc strings as section bodies.<BR>

<LI>Minimal source parsing to get class and function names.<BR>

<LI>Some attempt is made to recognize textual attributes from ASCII text.
 For example "- spam" becomes: " spam"<BR>

<LI>Separate "manual page" for each module function and class.<BR>
</UL>


<H2><A NAME=3D"HDR1">2.  My attempt at automatic generation of documentation
for extension modules</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>Currently just for extension modules<BR>

<LI>One "manual page" per module<BR>
<A HREF="doc.figure.id.1.gif"><img src="doc.figure.id.1.gif"></A><p>

<LI>Section for module functions<BR>

<LI>A section for each built-in type <BR>
<A HREF="doc.figure.id.2.gif"><img src="doc.figure.id.2.gif"></A><p>

<LI>Each function or method is a sub-section<BR>

<LI>If doc string is of form <BR>
"spam(a,b,) -- Description of spam ...", then the subsection heading is 
"spam(a,b)" as in the Python library reference.<BR>
<A HREF="doc.figure.id.3.gif"><img src="doc.figure.id.3.gif"></A><p>
</UL>


<H3><A NAME=3D"HDR2">2.1.  Problems</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Extension modules need to export types<BR>

<LI>Need to be able to get at method doc strings without creating instances.<BR>
</UL>


<H3><A NAME=3D"HDR3">2.2.  Proposal</A></H3>
I suggest the creation of a "method list" type. Method list object
pointers could optionally be created by extension modules and a pointer put in
the type object structure. <p>
A standard getattr function should also be provided that uses method lists
objects. Perhaps python could call it automatically.<p>
I would be willing to come up with a first-cut implementation.<p>
Method list object requirements?<p>

<UL>
<LI>Get ands store method names, function pointers, and doc strings from
existing method-list structure.<BR>

<LI>Optionally use a dictionary to speed method lookup for large method
lists.<BR>

<LI>Other method information? (e.g. signatures)<BR>

<LI>???<BR>
</UL>


<H2><A NAME=3D"HDR4">3.  Should we say anything more about doc string format?
</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>Organization?<BR>

<LI>Format Markup?<BR>

<LI>Structure Markup?<BR>

<LI>Implicit markup? (e.g. "- spam" -&gt; " spam")<BR>
</UL>


It is critical for doc strings to be readily available in the interpreter,
so if explicit markup is used, then we need to provide standard
formatting tools within the interpreter. <p>
