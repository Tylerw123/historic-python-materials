<H1>Tutorials at the Third Python Workshop</H1>

The tutorial fee will be $50 for a single tutorial session, or $100
for any combination of two or three sessions.  <A
href="registration.html#cost">(See registration page for details.)</A>
Please  indicate which tutorials topics you plan to attend.  Rank them
if you are interested in more than one.

There are two tutorial tracks, in the time slot 7:00-9:00 AM on
Mon-Wed December 4-6, 1995.  One track extends across the entire three
days: <P>

<UL>
<LI> Mon-Wed 7-9 AM: Extending and Embedding Python, Guido van Rossum
</UL>



The other track includes one two-day sequence and a single-day
session: <P>

<UL>
<LI> Mon-Tue 7-9 AM: Python and the WWW, Digital Creations
<LI> Wed 7-9 AM: Python on a Windows machine, Mark Hammond
</UL>

Here are some details about two of the tutorial sequences: <P>

<HR>

<DL>
<DT> <H3>Extending and Embedding Python</H3>
<DD> <Strong>Instructor:</Strong>Guido van Rossum
<UL>
<LI>Day 1: Writing a Python extension module in C or C++
<LI>Day 2: Defining new Python object types in an extension module
<LI>Day 3: Embedding the Python interpreter in other applications
</UL>
Required background: experience in Python programming; experience in C
programming; some experience in building Unix applications using Make.
Topics discussed will also include:
<UL>
<LI>Using other languages, e.g. Fortran
<LI>Interfacing to external libraries
<LI>Tools that help you create extension modules, e.g. Modulator
<LI>Interacting with the standard Python object types from C
<LI>Invoking the Python interpreter from C
<LI>Building extensions on non-Unix platforms
</UL>
<DT> <H3>Designing World Wide Web services using Python</H3>
<DD> <Strong>Instructor:</Strong>Paul Everitt, or someone like him
<BR>
This tutorial will teach the use of Python for delivering Internet  
services.  After a discussion of the problem domain (mainly the  
WWW), we will begin with CGI programming, using Python, on  
various platforms with various WWW servers.    <P>
 
Then, we will discuss how to use the Digital Creations' software to do  
non-CGI applications.  This will introduce CORBA programming using  
ILU, and our interface into the httpd API.  <P>

<H4>Objectives</H4>

<UL>
<LI> using Python as a CGI scripting language 
<LI> how (and why) to leap past CGI's limitations using distributed objects 
<LI> introduction to ILU and Python 
</UL>

</DL>


<HR>
