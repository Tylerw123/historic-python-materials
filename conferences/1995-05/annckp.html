<H1>The Second Python Workshop</H1>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Workshop Announcement</STRONG>
<DD>
The Second Python Workshop is scheduled for May 22, 23, 24, and 25.
It will be held in Menlo Park, CA at the U.S. Geological
Survey facility (U.S.G.S.).  (Thanks go
to Jim Fulton for making arrangements for the facility.) Here is a
list with <A HREF="hotels.html">hotel information</A> and a <A
HREF="USGS_map.gif">map to the USGS</A>.   

<DT><STRONG>Call for Papers and for Volunteers</STRONG> 
<DD> 

As was done at the last workshop, facilitators have been assigned to
each topic area.  Papers for the meeting can be submitted prior
to the meeting, or as reports after the meeting.  You do not
have to attend the workshop to submit a paper and you don't have to
submit a paper to attend the workshop.  Please send papers to
mclay@eeel.nist.gov to have them included in the proceedings.  All the
proceedings will be published on the Web.

<P>

DEADLINE: The proceedings will be published as a Web document so the
publishing deadline is flexible.  We would like the papers in as soon
as possible, but some reports will be completed after the meeting.  It
would be helpful to give others attending the workshop a chance to
preview your work, so please send in a title and abstract as soon as
you can.  You can send in an early draft or your papers if work is
still in progress, we can always update a paper at a later date.

<DT><STRONG>Workshop Fee</STRONG>
<DD>

This second workshop will not have a fee.  Donations to cover the cost
of a refreshments may be collected at the meeting.

<P> 

We are fortunate in that this second meeting will be another freebee.
In the future we expect it will be necessary to charge a fee for the
workshops.

<DT><STRONG>Signing up for the Workshop</STRONG>
<DD>
To sign up to attend send an email to mclay@eeel.nist.gov.  We are
starting to approach the capacity of the room, so if you plan on
attending, please be sure to send a note as soon as possible.
