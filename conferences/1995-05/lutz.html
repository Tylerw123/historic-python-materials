<H1>Papers by Mark Lutz</H1>
Mark Lutz has contributed two documents for the
workshop proceedings. The first paper, in Postscript format, is on <A
href="kelintegp.ps">KEL: C++/Python Integration</A>.  This 
is a review of Mark's experience with using Python as an embedded
language.  
<P>
We asked Mark to provide a sneak preview of his book on Python.  
He obliged with an encapsulated Postscript format submission that
contains a book preview for <A href="outlinep.eps"><EM>Using
Pyton</EM></A>.  The book should be ready for the publisher by the
fall of 1995.  

<P>
We'll try to get an HTML version of the documents added to the
proceeedings after the workshop.
