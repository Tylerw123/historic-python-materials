<h2>Work in Progress Reports</h2>

<h3> Python and the Web (Guido van Rossum)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Recently took the html parser from Tim Berners Lee 
       and put it in 1.2
  <li> You can write an extensible WWW browser in Python
  <li> Can also easily write a robot that runs the web
       (Infoseek has done this in Python)
  <li> Safe Python
  <ul>
    <li> Allow you to take a python program from the web and
         run it in a restricted environment
    <li> One thing needed is an uncatchable exception so you can
         send an alarm to a running program to terminate it
  </ul>
  <li> Also working on a HTTP server class
  <ul>
    <li> work involves putting CGI functionality directly in the
         server for performance
    <li> none of this is completely working 
    <li> planning on release for 1.3
    <li> Might also be nice to redo imagemaps in a better way
         (e.g. better way to determine regions)
  </ul>
  <li> Already a client class and a CGI class
  <li> Also working on <i> remote import </i>
  <ul>
    <li> it would be really nice to have URL's on sys.path
    <li> efficiency could be a problem if the URL's were towards
         the beginning of the path, especially if the net is slow
         or the server is down
    <li> ...so caching is needed, currently underway
    <li> negative caching also (e.g. the server did *not* have the
	 module)
    <li> There are curently there levels of confidence
    <ul>
      <li> level 0, believe the cache
      <li> level 1, check the dates if they are diffenent, get the
           file
      <li> level 2, just get the file
    </ul>
    <li> Question to the audience, How do you trust a remote import?
    <ul>
      <li> ... no good answers, standard network authentication
      <li> this doesn't prevent a trojan horse 
    </ul>
    <li> POST currently calls a CGI script
  </ul>
  <li> CNRI work on URN's
       <a href = "http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/home/cstr/handle-intro.html">
       handle server project</a>
  <ul>
    <li> URN's are sort of <i> location independant URL's</i>
    <li> URN's just name the document uniquely and a server
         gives you the actual location of the document
    <li> CNRI currently has working handle servers 
    <li> Guido's been working on a handle server interface in Python
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h3> SQL in Python, Python in SQL (Aaron Watters)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> All the spare moments I have been implementing a prototype
     database manager based on Python (e.g. SQL implemented in
     python)
  <li> SQL engines are very expensive
  <li> want to get this out for free
  <li> a filled-out implementation count be, if not a killer-app,
       at least used in the universitys 
  <li> Right now in the form of a proof-of-concept demo
  <li> currently parsing is takes as long as the actual query
  <li> currently has the SELECT statement working
  <li> if it was ALL in python it would be slower
  <li> Futures
  <ul>
     <li> interfaces to existing databases
     <li> more SQL
     <li> timestamping, more...
  </ul>
  <li> Also working on a different project that would present a bunch of
       python classes as relation database information. (e.g. Object
       oriented view of relational database)
</ul>
<h3> Andrew Kuchlings's Python Cryptographer's toolkit (Ken
     Manheimer) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Pretty substantial collection of cryptography functions written in C
       with Python Class wrappers - so probably pretty fast
  <li> Got into this work as way of writing a python one-time password
       generator based on a shared secret DES key
  <li> kit contains a bunch of encryption algorithm's, hashing functions,
       and even some encoumbered code that forbids commercial use
  <li> GNU public licence currently in use
  <li> talking about writing wrappers for kerberos and Netscape's SSL
</ul>
<h3> Khoros module - an image processing package (Raymond Suorsa - NASA)
     </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Khoros Overview
  <ul>
    <li> Huge image processing system
    <li> can find edges, etc.
    <li> current version is 2.0
    <li> free on the net
    <li> good a working on large datasets (e.g.  the whole dataset does
         not have to be in memory)
    <li> Organization
    <ul>
      <li>	presentation layer
      <li>	data pipeline
      <li>	pysical layer
    </ul>
    <li> Khiros interface 
    <ul>
      <li> Kroutines -	unix shell interface
      <ul>
        <li> Pro - all of Khoros in one shot
        <li> Pro - no recompilation needed during testing
        <li> Con - costly execution
        <li> Con - aggressive dynamic binding is probably a bad thing
      </ul>
      <li> Klibrary -	c library interface - most efficient
      <ul>
        <li> Pro - fast execution with explicit binding
	<li> Con - 25 Megs of source
	<li> Con - Khorosmodule.c becomes HUGE
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li> Python/Khoros Interface
  <ul>
      <li> simple example...
      <pre>
	import khoros
	lenna = khoros.get("lenna.xv")
	edgeLenna = khoros.kr("ingradient", args...)
      </pre>	
      <li> Can perform some degree of operations on kr objects
      <pre>
	lennaConCat = lenna + edgeLenna 	# add images together
      </pre>
  </ul>
  <li> What's next
  <ul>
    <li> Get Khoral research interested
    <li> incorporate multidimentional slicing with the ':' notation
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3> Fortran Matrix extension (Jim Fulton - USGS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Able to call fortran
  <li> interface is simplified
  <li> error checking compatible with python exceptions
  <li> fortran routings handle input arrays polymorphically
  <li> simple built-in matrix type included
  <li> Documentation strings
  <li> fidl - provides a mechanism for calling fortran routines from Python
  <ul>
    <li> each fortran module is described in a fidl spec
    <li> each fortran routine has a fidl spec
    <li> the fidl compiler generates the python stubs from the specs
  </ul>
  <li> Matrices
  <ul>
    <li> similar to array objects
    <li> homogeneous data
    <li> n-dimensional arrays  behave like sequences of n-1 dimentinal
         arrays
    <li> foo[i][j][k] = spam    - works and works efficiently
  </ul>
  <liL Example
  <pre>
	import interp
	b,c - dcsakm([0, .1, .2, .5], [100, 200, 10, 50])
	for i in range(50):
		print dcsval(i/100.0,b,c)
  </pre>
  <li> Note the Doc string in the function...
  <pre>
	Fit an Akima spline function

	Usage: csbreak, cscoef = dcsakm(xdata, fdata)
  </pre>
</ul>
<h3> MMACE's application execution control panel (Michael McLay) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Design tools for the MicroWave and Millimeter industry
  <li> Using python for a nice front-end
  <li> Demo...
</ul>
<h3> Career Web (Eric Bouck) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://kracken.bevc.blacksburg.va.us/~ebouck/workshop2/cweb.html">
       Overview Presentation</a>
</ul>
<h3> <a name="infoseek"> InfoSeek (Andy Benskey & Jim Roskind- InfoSeek) </a> </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.infoseek.com"> Home Page</a>
  <li> Used python after trying to implement an http server in perl
  <li> modules written to handle accounting, etc
  <li> searches are actually done in C
  <li> python threads were not used - heavy weight forks used instead
  <ul>
    <li> problem was with reaping child processes due to some signal
         wierdness
    <li> used a dictionary stuffed with function calls... nice alternative 
         to if-then-if - much faster too
    <li> would be nice to have sys.environ more tightly coupled with 
         the actual environment
    <li> Guido - 'I hear you'
    <li> developed a persistent object store
    <ul>
      <li> we want an object to survive beyond the process boundry
      <li> pobject.py
      <li> to deal with <i> type evolution </i> one overrides methods 
           derived from a base class that was a persistent object
      <li> Examples
      <pre>
	class M(pobject):
	  def ...
	m = M()
	m.SetAlias('jar')
	m2.FindAlias('jar')
	m2.Find('jar')
	m.GetID()
      </pre>
      <li> store an object in human-readable form... so above would be file:
	   <b> M..jar </b> wich has a very python-dictionary like contents
      <li> much like <i> pickle </i>
      <li> supports the notion of polymorhphism
      <li> strong relationship between naming and persistence
      <li> implementation handles recursion
	<pre>
	   x = []
	   x.append(x)
	   # now archive this!
	</pre>
    </ul>
    <li> developed a profiler with statistics generation capability
         so one could determine where python is spending its time
    <ul>
      <li> why is this function being called 1500 times?
      <li> profile.py
      <li> <pre> run(" program ") </pre>
      <li> pstats.py
      <li> pstats.sort_stats().print_stats() # sorting and printing statistics 
    </ul>
    <li> contributing both to python distribution
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3> The PLplot module (Michael McLay) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Part of the MMACE demo...
</ul>
<h3> Identifying important extensions, current and future (Michael McLay) </h3>
<h3> contributing modules to the PSA </h3>
<h3> Executable HTML documents (Diane Hackborn - Oregon State University) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.cs.orst.edu/~hackbod/exechtml/">Information
       page</a>
  <li> Interface does not depend on python
  <li> Another language could be dropped in cleanly
  <li> Currently uses sockets to go back to the server (needs to be replaced
       with URL's)
  <li> Python interpreter is linked into the browser for performance

</ul>
