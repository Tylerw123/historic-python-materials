This paper introduces the <STRONG>Gadfly</STRONG> prototype database
manager which implements standard SQL in the Python prototyping
language.  It also briefly considers the possibility of embedding
Python objects into a database management system in order to
add object oriented features to relational technology, thus
defining an object oriented database system.

<P>
The Gadfly prototype is aimed at adding basic database functionality
to the Python prototyping language using
the SQL standard.  
Many possible uses for a light weight and portable database manager
based in Python come to mind -- from use in system administration
tools, to use in generic data based applications,
to use in multi-database interoperability.
<P>
One possible use for the prototype that might become feasible fairly
soon could be as a vehicle for database publication.  For example, it
might be possible to fit Python and the prototype in a corner of a
CD-rom (precompiled and configured for various platforms), with the
remainder of the CD devoted to a fairly large database.  Under such a
scenario, the CD could encapsulate code for arbitrarily complex and
convenient access to the data it contains, together with the ability
to present and the manipulate the data using Python's scripting and
graphical capabilities.
<P>
There is a much to be done before any of these visions
will become a reality.
This section discusses the current state of the prototype as
well as planned extensions.


<H2><A NAME="Status">Status</A></H2>
<P>
Gadfly currently supports a significant subset of the
SQL data manipulation language, as specified in MicroSoft's
ODBC reference documentation
(<CITE>ODBC 2.0 Programmers Reference and SDK Guide</CITE>
 MicroSoft Press, 1994), and in the near
future it will support a much larger subset.  The development
is aimed at supporting SQL before adding more ``modern'' or
experimental features, because (as Serge Abiteboul once put
it) SQL is an intergalactic standard, and the prototype is
much more likely to be used if it supports SQL than if it
came with its own data manipulation language only.  Gadfly
has a simple, but nice, graphical user interface which runs
under the Tk toolkit.  Python programs may ``embed'' accesses
to databases using Gadfly, but the present 
applications programmer interface needs to
be cleaned up before it is documented and released.
<P>
At present the prototype is most appropriate for educational
and experimental use.  Nevertheless, hooks are in place for
full database functionality including
all of standard SQL with concurrency control and recovery,
together with external interfaces to other data repositories of arbitrary
kinds, as well as for the addition of ``active'' features
such as triggers and external actions.  I will devote most of
the summer to improving the prototype and to adding the features
listed above.

<H2><A NAME="Implementation">Implementation</A></H2>
<P>
If nothing else, Gadfly is an interesting example of
a strategy for developing reasonably large applications
in Python.  The most interesting aspect of the prototype
is that, although the size of the Python code is considerable,
most of the ``hard work'' of query evaluation is done by
the <CODE> kjbuckets</CODE> C extension module, which defines
appropriate abstract data types for the problem at hand.
<P>
<STRONG> Query Evaluation:</STRONG>
The core to any SQL engine is the <CODE> SELECT</CODE> statement, and
Gadfly supports most of the <CODE> SELECT</CODE> statement, and soon
will support all of it.  In particular, the query engine supports
<UL>
<LI>
the standard <CODE> SELECT</CODE> 
(with <CODE> DISTINCT</CODE> or <CODE> ALL</CODE> including expressions and
renaming), <CODE> FROM</CODE>, <CODE> GROUP BY</CODE>, and <CODE> ORDER BY</CODE> clauses;
<LI>
the <CODE> WHERE</CODE> clause with most standard predicates and
expressions to arbitrary complexity, including the embedded
subquery predicates <CODE> EXISTS</CODE> and <CODE> IN</CODE> and their
negations.
<LI>
the <CODE> HAVING</CODE> clause (except that references to external
aggregates in embedded subqueries are not yet supported).
<LI>
the standard aggregate functions such as <CODE> SUM(expr)</CODE>
and <CODE> COUNT(DISTINCT expr)</CODE>.
</UL>
Most other standard parts of the <CODE> SELECT</CODE> statement
syntax can be (and will be) added fairly easily.
Neither the <CODE> LIKE</CODE> predicate nor the <CODE> UNION</CODE> clause
have been implemented, but they will not cause any difficulty.
The general subquery constructs
<CODE>Theta-ANY</CODE> and <CODE>Theta-ALL</CODE> need to
be added, but do not present any difficulties either.
Hooks are in place to support views and subselects in the
<CODE> FROM</CODE> clause, but these features are not yet present.
<P>
The internal logic used to implement query evaluation is
based on an extension of relational algebra using a cylindric
formulation.  The basis in
cylindrical algebra maps easily to fast operations on graphs, sets,
and mappings which allows the prototype to optimize equality based
accesses reasonably well -- especially since the basic set operations
are implemented in a C extension to Python (<CODE> kjbuckets</CODE>) which
does most of the ``hard work''.
<P>
The query planning and query evaluation use hash-based accesses,
hashed semijoins, and hashed joins heavily.  As yet there is no attempt to
optimize ``range queries'' involving inequalities.  Consequently
of

<PRE>
   select * from r,s where r.a&lt;=s.b and r.a&gt;=s.b;
   select * from r,s where r.a=s.b
</PRE>

the second query will execute much faster than the first,
in general -- since the equality testing of the second is
``implemented in C'' and translates to a ``hash join'' or r and s
 whereas inequality comparisons of the first are
``interpreted in Python'' over a cross product of 
r and s.  In the long term ``range'' based
evaluation optimizations would be nice, but this is a low priority.
At binding time, static transformations
are done to simplify expressions and conditions.  Thus
in the following ``parse dump''
<PRE>
> select * from dr where not (dr <> 'wendy')
parsed representation:
  select *
  from FREQ FREQ
  where (DR='wendy')
</PRE>
the (slow) non-inequality is translated to a (fast) equality.  
<P>
Further discussion of the internals of the 
query processing engine are beyond the
scope of this presentation.

<P>
<STRONG> Parsing:</STRONG>
Gadfly parses SQL statements with the help of a Parser generator
and a parsing module
also written in Python.  These are modified
versions of the <CODE> kwParsing</CODE> modules available at the
the Python FTP sites -- modified to do parser
<EM>generation</EM> somewhat faster, and to report
parse errors better.}  Unfortunately, the parser 
(which uses no significant C extension aids) is a minor
speed bottleneck which should be sped up at some point,
perhaps by using <CODE> Lex</CODE> and <CODE> YACC</CODE> in place of
the Python based parser generator.
<P>
<STRONG> User interface:</STRONG>
The current graphical user interface to the prototype uses
a small ``forms'' module built on top of Python's standard
interface to the Tk graphical toolkit.  
The interface at present is oriented
towards demonstrating the capabilities of the system, and
debugging, but it will be easy to extend the strategy
to allow standard form-based accesses (such as inserting
or modifying a row using a form).  This interface is suitable
for extension, both to provide more extensive native features
for the prototype, and for use as an application programmer
tool.

<H2><A NAME="Future">Future</A></H2>
<P>
There are many planned extensions to the the prototype.
They divide into basic extensions (which should be addressed
before the system is used for non-toy applications), 
near future extensions (which may be included in near future
releases of the prototype), and longer term extensions
(ideas that may or may not ever be implemented).

<H3><A NAME="Basic">Basic extensions</A></H3>
<P>
The following extensions to the prototype should
be added before it is released for non-experimental
use.
<P>
<STRONG> Near Complete SQL support:</STRONG>
There are a number of SQL constructs that are not yet supported
by the prototype.  Often, the functionality to support the
construct is present, but has not been ``connected'' with the
syntax.  Many more constructs will be supported, but some
of the more idiosyncratic features may be deferred.
<P>
<STRONG> Concurrency control and recovery:</STRONG>
Non-read-only applications require the ability to recover
from a system failure.  I plan to add a basic recovery
strategy to the prototype using ``incremental logging with
deferred updates''.  The prototype will use a time-stamp based
protocol to prevent concurrent access conflicts -- largely
because time-stamping is more amenable to an ``object
oriented'' view of data, as well as for loosely coupled
distributed applications.  Since the initial versions of the
prototype will be restricted to single process access, the
initial implementation may not provide full concurrency
control, but will be designed to allow the addition of
timestamping without requiring major restructuring of the code.
<P>
<STRONG> External data sources:</STRONG>
The concept of a ``table'' will be implemented as a class
that permits derived classes to define data accesses in
arbitrary ways.  Thus it will be possible for an applications
programmer to define a class which, for example, parses
and loads and dumps system administration configuration files 
(such as the unix <CODE> /etc/passwd</CODE> file or the various X
configuration files, or the files of the linux
<CODE> proc</CODE> file system) as SQL tables.  An immediate internal
application of this interface will be to add a persistent
indexed relation class using the <CODE> dbm</CODE> Python indexed file
interface.
<P>
<STRONG> Forms:</STRONG>
With some minor extension
the ``forms'' module of the prototype 
will allow applications programmers
to develop their own input forms, as well as graphical
reports.  Eventually the Tk based interface should also
be ``cloned'' to provide a version that uses the HTTP
protocol to allow remote users to access data managed under
the prototype using the World-Wide-Web -- a conceptually
straightforward exercise.
<P>
<STRONG> Improved applications programmer interface:</STRONG>
Partially because I haven't decided what a good API
should look like, the present API interface to the
database engine is not yet suitable for external use.
One or more applications programmer interface strategies
will be added to the prototype to allow Python scripts
to conveniently access and modify data managed under the prototype.

<H3><A NAME="Near">Near future extensions</A></H3>
<P>
A number of additional features will be added to the prototype
in the near term.  These include basic extensions to functionality,
and experimental extensions.
<P>
<STRONG> Active Database Features:</STRONG>
The prototype will implement transactions using a
synchronous active database model.
This strategy will permit the database to check
complex consistency constraints, to trigger other modifications
automatically from user requested modifications, 
to define arbitrary ``view updates,'' and to spawn
external actions automatically from database interactions.
As a simple example of an external action a new entry
in a ``customer'' table may spawn electronic mail to
a salesman telling the salesman to start harassing the
new customer, or a new entry in the ``reviews'' table
may spawn automatic mail to the author of a submitted
journal paper, telling the author that the author's paper has
been rejected (or possibly, accepted -- but this is highly
unlikely).
<P>
<STRONG> Relational Algebra:</STRONG>
Primarily for educational use, and because it will be
easy to add, the prototype will include a tk-based relational
algebra interpreter.  This component may be useful to database instructors
with lots of students that can't seem to understand the
relational algebra.
<P>
<STRONG> Multi-threaded multiple session support:</STRONG>
The prototype will be extended to allow multiple concurrent
access by making use of multi-threading and by completing
the concurrency control and recover strategies outlined above.
Eventually this extension will allow an instance of the prototype
to function as a server which remote clients can access
simultaneously.

<H3><A NAME="Long">Longer term extensions</A></H3>
<P>
Many possible extensions present themselves, below are some
of the more compelling possibilities.  Some of these stretch
goals require significant thought and research, below are
brief sketches of the concepts.
<P>
<STRONG> ODBC interface protocol:</STRONG>
An ODBC driver for the prototype would allow other
software to access data managed by the prototype without
modification to any components.  Thus, for example, Lotus Notes
programs could connect to the prototype via the ODBC driver and
extract data into a report.  Hence a database published
on a CDROM that included the prototype could be loaded onto
a personal computer, and accessed using all sorts of
standard software without the need for
any special purpose code.  If such an ODBC driver ever comes into
being, the prototype will be a very compelling vehicle for
database publication.
<P>
<STRONG> Distributed access:</STRONG>
By folding the data access interface with the client/server
access protocol it should be possible to make one instance
of the prototype act as a client to several other remote 
server instances
of the prototype -- where the ``servers'' appear to be simple
data sources to the client.  Under this model the prototype
could be used to build simple distributed databases.
<P>
<STRONG> Multi-database access:</STRONG>
By interfacing API's for other database managers to Python,
it should be possible to allow external databases managed
(for example) by Oracle or Sybase to appear as data sources
for the prototype.   Using these interfaces the prototype
could be used as a database ``glue'' tool which allows queries
and accesses to span multiple autonomous databases.

<H2><A NAME="PyInDB">Python as a Database</A></H2>
<P>
Let's forget about Gadfly for a moment and consider the
more general possibilities of combining Python with a
database manager.  In particular, this section considers
the possibility of defining a simple object oriented database
system by embedding python structures within a relational
database system.
<P>
A moments thought reveals that Python is ``nothing more''
than a relatively simple relational database with some
useful C code tacked on.

<P>
I have no really deep insights to offer here -- this is
more of a topic for discussion -- but note that it would
be a relatively simple exercise to embed all data from a
Python process into any database manager that supported
unbounded strings or binary large objects (BLOBs).  Using
such an archiving strategy together with the internal hooks
already in place in Python it should be possible for a
Python process to connect to a database and import modules,
classes, instances and other objects from the database, modify them, and
export them back to the database.  This raises the possibility
that Python could be combined with an arbitrary relational
database manager to define an object oriented database
system.
<P>
Analogous tools along these lines already exist for other
languages.  For instance Persistence is a package which
combines C++ with database managers in such a manner.
There is a great deal of excitement about Persistence at
places such as AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories -- but my moles
tell me that the actual use of Persistence is quite difficult.
In my view, these difficulties derive from the peculiarities
of C++ and from the fact that C++ is 
compiled.  For example, a C++ object cannot be examined for
its components except at compile time using complex
precompilation tools.  Thus Persistence requires many
precompilation and code generation steps that would be
unnecessary in an interpreted language such as Python.
The greater elegance and simplicity of Python,
as well as its interpreted nature, makes Python far more
appropriate for embedding in a database.
<P>
There seems to be a great need for combining object oriented
database systems while preserving the advantages of the
standard relational approach.  I believe that with some work
Python could be used to address these needs.

<H2><A NAME="Thoughts">Thoughts</A></H2>
<P>
I believe the Gadfly prototype (once it has filled out a bit)
may be useful as a data
management tool -- for one, because it is fast enought
to be useful.  The embedded C extension <CODE> kjbuckets</CODE>
provides the prototype with its speed, and were it not
for <CODE> kjbuckets</CODE> the prototype would be far less compelling.
<P>
At a general level, I would draw from this observation that
Python could benefit from a larger suite of abstract data
types (ADTs) implemented in C.  If more C implemented ADTs
were available Python programmers could at once make their
code faster, smaller, clearer, and more supportable by using them.
<P>
Among the ADTs I would like to see are
<UL>
<LI>
Efficient order based mappings, perhaps using B-trees
both implemented in memory and on the file system.
<LI>
A priority queue type.
<LI>
Matrix and other math support (perhaps via an interface
to the standard CLAPACK math library).
<LI>
Types for efficient support of larger parsing problems
and keyword matching -- such as a trigram
based graph
implementation where <CODE> G[&quot;.*thon.*&quot;]</CODE> might retrieve
a keyword list such as 
<CODE> [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;marathon&quot;, &quot;thong&quot;]</CODE>.
</UL>
Other ADT ideas with suggested implementations can be found
by cracking open any data structures book.  Better C level
aggregate conversion routines for existing Python types
would also be useful.
<P>
With more ADTs Python would be an even better language
for accomplishing Don Knuth's dream of ``literate programming''
and Python coding would be even more fun and rewarding.
