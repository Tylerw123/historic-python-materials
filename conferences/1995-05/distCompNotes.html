<h2>1) OpenDoc (Neil Katin - CI Labs)</h2>                                   
<ul>
<li>Overview
<ul>
  <li>         plug and play documents                 
  <li>         Rich multipart                          
  <li>         Architecture for making 'parts'         
</ul>
<li>Edit in place                                     
<ul>
  <li>         parts written separately then combined
  <li>         component part architecture
</ul>
<li>Linking and Scripting
<ul>
  <li>         very high level concepts, save to a file, etc.
  <li>         no one language will make everyone happy
  <li>         common language for scripts to communicate w/parts
  <li>         in order to run a python script, one needs an
            interpreter on your system (runned by OpenDoc shell)
</ul>
<li>Six technologies
<ul>
  <li>         OpenDoc Doc Architecture
  <li>         OLE interaoperability
  <li>         OpenDoc Component Architecture
  <li>         OSA (Automation)
  <li>         Bento (How to store things on disk)
  <li>         SOM  (Corba implementations)
</ul>
<li>Contrast with Visual Basic
<ul>
  <li>OpenDoc + Scripting language + toolkit is simmilar
  <li>OpenDoc is a lower level framework by itself
</ul>
<li>OMG
<ul>
  <li>Submitted to Common Facilities Task force
  <li>competing with Fresco
  <li>Built on top of CORBA
</ul>
<li>WordPerfect implementation is available via ftp
<li>Apple just release developer rel 2 (opendoc@apple.com)
<li>IBM OS/2 2 months behind, must buy developer package ($99)
<li>AIX port several months behind
<li>More info... contact CI labs info@cil.org
<p>
</ul>
<h2>2) ILU (Bill Janssen - Xerox PARC)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full slides from <A HREF=" ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">
here.</a>
<p>
<li>Inter-Language Unifications
<li>Attempts to eliminate the differences between languages
<li>define interfaces bewteen libraries
<li>support over 100 languages supported
<ul>
<li>        Smalltalk, C, C++, Modula-3, lisp Python, TCL
</ul>
<li>you can write your own
<li>Like to be able to 'mix-and-match' languages
<li>want librariy use used in the same address space to be fast
<li>want to support CORBA
<li>Simple types
<li>Object Model supports methods only, no data slots
<li>asyncronous methods (send data, don't wait for reply)
<li>works with both comiled and interpreted languages
<li>uses multiple inheritence
<li>deal with heterogenaety rather than try to fight it
<li>ILU extends CORBA
<li>Been out for about a year (version 1.8 released Mar 95)
<li>Very open to suggestions for python implementation changes
<p>
</ul>
<h2>3) CORBA (Saurabh Srivastava - SGI - Iteractive TV project)</h2>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Extending Python to be an applications development environment
<li>for Interactive TV.
<li>The CPU and other resources at the setup-box is assumed limited
<li>6 Meg of memory is typical for a consumer setup box
<li>Just launched a system in Orlando
<li>Just now at the point of being able to do 'killer applications'
<li>Chose Python for:
<ul>
  <li>	 namespace scoping scales well
  <li>	 interoperability with C, C++
</ul>
<li>Service Architecture
<ul>
  <li>	 Client/Server
  <li>	 Each server is a single process on IRIX
  <li>	 clients can run on IRIX or the settop
  <li>	 name service provides a 'global' namespace at
  	  a well-known-port for client access
  <li>	 All servers advertize themselves using unique names
  <li>	 Two ways of supporting replicated services
  <li>	 Not TCP but reliable one-way messaging
  <li>	 IDL stubs manage transparency automatically
  <li>	 IDL stubs are C++ stubs not Python
  <li>	 The video channel is reserved and not transported
  	  over IP
</ul>
<li>CORBA Interface
<ul>
  <li>	on settop box you have a python program running
	with a stub interface to the CORBA DII - looks
	like a python method call!  Or you can go to IDL 
	directly via the C++ stub (uglier)
  <li>	Have plans to build a 'Mamba' (their name for python)
	authoring environment:
  <ul>
    <li>		 Debugger
    <li>		 Class Browser
    <li>		 Script editor
    <li>		 Timeline Editor
    <li>		 3D Modeler
    <li>		 Properties Editor
    <li>		 Spatial Editor
    <li>		 Overview Editor
  </ul>
  <li>	Also needed:
  <ul>
    <li>		 Project Management
    <li>		 Asset Management
    <li>		 Data driven templates
    <li>		 Rich set of transitions
    <li>		 support Set Tops of dirverse capabilites
    <li>		 Perview on IRIX i18n
  </ul>
<li>	Security is based on authentication via shared DES
<li>	secret key encryption
<li>	Status:
<ul>
  <li>		Nothing in the Authoring envirnment is finished
  <li>		Extension modules IDL, etc, is finished
  <li>		More work needs to be done on size (now big)
</ul>
<p>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>4) OLE (Jim Ahlstrom)</h2>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Object Linking and Embedding
<li>Microsoft product - turn on your reality meter :-)
<li>A way for multiple applications to work together
<li>e.g. a Word processor and a spreadsheet
<ul>
  <li>	 how do you deal with the spreadsheet from the WP?
  <li>	 this is about the only thing that's working today
</ul>
<li>Container App
<li>Server App
<li>OLE 2.0 seems complicated
<li>Feature called inplace activation
<ul>
  <li>	 When you pull in an app with OLE a new menu item
  <li>	 Hard with OLE, easy with something like NEXTSTEP 
	  that has late binding	
</ul>
<li>Feature called automation
<li>A way of 'pickling' data for transport between 'Object'
<li>They have a set of interfaces (like ObjC protocols)
<li>They have a ways of testing for interfacing
<li>32-bit version is hot-off-the-press
<li>OLE also available for Microsoft Foundation Classes (better)
<li>Use OSF/DCE to (sort of) communicate across process boundries
<li>Doesn't work with CORBA or OpenDoc (booo hiss)
<li>Microsoft does not 'seem' interested in this technology
<li>OLE across a net is supported in Chiro (so OS change 
<li>to this next version of NT will be necessary)
<li>DEC to provide the OLE to Corba linkage (3rd party)
<p>
</ul>
<h2>	5) Objects on the net (Guido van Rossum)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Working on turning a python Class into a server
<li> Developed a class to represent the current directory
  using the platform independant features of the os module
<li>  Next using MI the class becomes a server
<li>  On the client side, we pickle everything while
  checking for exceptions, then sends the pickle
  over the socket, complete with possible exceptions
<li> exceptions can be meaningless if they're not found
<li> Wrote an application that syncronized two file systems
<li> Does md5 checksum and does not ship it if files are the same
<li> This could be done with ILU... maybe a bit slower
</ul>
