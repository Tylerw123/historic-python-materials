<h2> The Python object API proposals (Jim Fulton) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> An abstract python object interface for Python C modules
  <li> Python modules written in C that must access Python objects 
       must do so through routines described by a set of includes
  <li> unfortunately, these routines vary according to to object 
       being accessed
  <li> to use there routines the programmer must check the type of
       the object being used and must call the routine based on the
       object type
  <li> Memory management
  <ul>
    <li> certain semantics, expecially memory mamagement may differ
 	 by the type of the object being used 
    <li> unfortuntely there semantics are not cleary described in
         the current include files
  </ul>
  <li> Proposal
  <ul>
    <li> the creation of a standard interface with an associated 
	 set of routines or macros
    <li> Framework
    <ul>
      <li>From the view of C access to Python
      <ul>
        <li> very-high-level layer
        <li> abstract object layer (Subject of this talk)
        <ul>
          <li> contains functions for abstractly operating on objects
          <li> polymorphic
          <li> lets you do many of the same things that  you can do in
	       the interpreter
	  <li> PyObject* is central
	  <li> also mentions routine constructors needed to build
	       objects of standard types
        </ul>
	<li> concrete layer
        <ul>
	  <li> specific object types
	  <li> layer documented by includes
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li> From the view of Python access to C 
      <ul>
        <li> Python module interface
        <ul>
	  <li> what is expected from a Python module
	  <li> currently in the extensions documents
	  <li> built-in object interface
          <ul>
	    <li> This interface is currently the most undocumented
	    <li> You can infer syntax from <i> Modulator </i>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li> Purpose of this work
  <ul>
    <li> To provide an abstract object interface
    <li> To preserve interpreter semantics
    <li> To document the abstract object interface
  </ul>
  <li> Behaviors
  <ul>
    <li> The abstract object interface will provide four behaviors
    <ul>
      <li> object
      <li> numeric
      <li> sequence
      <li> mapping
    </ul>
    <li> Each behavior constists of a colletion of related operations
    <li> If an operation that is not provided by a particlar type is
	 invoked, then a standard exception <i> AttributeError </i> is
	 raised with an operation name as value
    <li> Behaviors also include semantics, which are not evident in 
	 operation signatures
  </ul>
  <li> Errors
  <ul>
    <li> functions that return pointers indicate errors by returning NULL
    <li> functions that return ints indicate errors by returning -1
    <li> some functions never generate errors including:
	<i> PyObject_Compare() </i> and the <i> PySpam_Check() </i> routines
  </ul>
  <li> Implementation is trivial - Most functionality exists already
  <li> Experience - implemented interfaces for
  <ul>
    <li> RDB (Rand not DEC)
    <li> ArcInfo
    <li> Ingres
  </ul>
  <li> Futures
  <ul>
    <li> Python C interface is a major strength of the language
    <li> Lack of documentation hurts
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2> Extensible Compound Statements (Jim Fulton) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> This talk is *not* about Transaction Processing
  <li> Looking at the use of nested transactions for distributed
       object programming
  <li> transactions have boundries
  <li> need some way of specifying those boundries
  <ul>
    <li> A code example (implies a 'transaction' keyword)
    <pre>
	transaction
		...some code that makes up the transaction
	try:
		transaction:
		...This is a sub-transacation
	except:
		handle failure of sub transaction...
	... more code for the first transaction...
    </pre>
    <li> A new compound statement is needed
    <pre>
 	Transaction.Begin()
		... some code ...
	Transaction.End()
    </pre>
    <li> problem - An exception might cause you not to execute
         'End()'
    <li> A possible solution...
    <pre>
	Tansaction.Begin()
	ok=0
	try:
		...some code...
		ok=1
	finally:
		if ok:
			Transaction.End()
		else:
			Transaction.Abort()
    </pre>
    <li> Problems
    <ul>
      <li> Exposes the transaction logic
      <li> complicated and therefore error prone
      <li> it obscures the application program
    </ul>
    <li> A generic routine designated to handle the transaction
    <pre>
	def mytransaction(v1,v2,v3):
		... some code ...
    </pre>
    <li> Function would propagate the exception back to the application
    <li> Disadvantage - must break flow to execute this function
    <li> Another Problem - Critical regions - must do locks
    <pre>
	lock.aquire()
		... some code ...
	lock.release()
    </pre>
    <li> Nested transactions - make things more complicated
    <li> Two cantidate proposals - both involve an <i> in </i> statement
    <pre>
	in expression:
		... some code ...

	in Transaction.Transaction():
		... some code for transaction t1
		try:
			in Transaction.Transaction():
				... some code for t2 ...
		except:
			... handle failure of t2
		... more code for t1
    </pre>
    <li> Proposal 1
    <ul>
      <li> convert the suite to a callable object
      <li> something that looks like a Smalltalk block is also
           possible
    </ul>
    <li> Proposal 2
    <ul>
      <li> call a special object before and after executing the suite
      <li> does not use code blocks
      <li> handles transactions and critical regions
      <li> does <i> not </i> handle threads and callbacks
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2> Optimizations Project (Jim Roskind - InfoSeek) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Two classes of optimization
  <ul>
    <li> Function calling
    <ul>
      <li> new op code called RESERVE_FAST
      <li> STORE_FAST 0, STORE_FAST 1, STORE_FAST 3, ...
           (there's a pattern forming here :-)
      <li> UNPACK_ARG to profile packing and unpacking
      <ul>
   	<li> obscure problem... 
	<pre>
        func(a, (b, c), d)  /* is 3 args but evaluates to 4 */
        </pre>
      </ul>
      <li> LOAD_GLOBAL
      <li> LOAD_CONST
      <li> BUILD_TUPLE - from the top two things on the stack
      <li> BINARY_CALL
    </ul>
    <li> Line numbers - Soon to be release module 'dis.py'
    <ul>
      <li> dissasembler
      <li> provides intermixed source and assembly
      <li> how many byte codes of each type occured?
      <li> has a magical op code called <i> SET_LINENO </i>
      <ul>
        <li> 15% of static instuctions call SET_LINENO
        <li> byte count is 18%
        <li> all the line number information is saved to 
             the end of a '.pyc' file
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li> Conclusions
  <ul>
    <li> 4% is dead code (e.g. unreachable)
    <li> 25% of all branches can be optimized
    <li> Play with this yourself with the soon-to-be-released <i> dis.py </i>
  </ul>
  <li> Discussion
  <ul>
    <li> malloc() and free() are the two big bozo's 
    <li> need a reasonably good set of benchmarks to make general
         statements
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2> More Issues with adding persistence to Python (Jim Roskind) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Introduced during the
       <a href="extModulesNotes.html#infoseek"> Extension Modules Session</a>
  <li> There's no way to do automatic garbage collection because
       you never know when the object may be reinstantiated
  <li> Why not use get_attr() and set_attr()?
  <li> What do you do when there's 10,000 items?
  <ul>
    <li> Optimization issue - may not need the entire inheritence
         chain of an un-pickled object
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2> Ideas on calling Python from an embedding environment (Mark Lutz) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="kelintegp.ps"> KEL</a>: A C++ / Python integration system
       (This is a 173KB escapsulated postscript file)
  <ul>
    <li> a mechanism for on-sight customization
    <li> a vehicle for rapid-prototyping
    <li> C++ to Python is very good
    <li> Python to C++ is not so good
    <li> For persistent objects in the Database, add some strings of
         Python code
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2> Python Book (Mark Lutz) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Book preview for <A href="outlinep.eps"><EM>Using Python</EM></A>.
       (This is a 108KB escapsulated postscript file)
  <li> The book should be ready for the publisher by the fall of 1995.  
</ul>
<h2> What's Next? Plans for 1.2.1, 1.3, 2.0 (Guido van Rossum) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Most if this is summarized in the <a href="/~guido/WIP.html">
       Work In Progress page.
</ul>
