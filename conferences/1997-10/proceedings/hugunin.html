Abstract</H2>
This paper describes a new working implementation of the Python language;
built on top of the Java language and run-time environment.&nbsp; This
is in contrast to the existing implementation of Python, which has been
built on top of the C language and run-time environment.&nbsp; Implementing
Python in Java has a number of limitations when compared to the current
implementation of Python in C.&nbsp; These include about 1.7X slower performance,
portability limited by Java VM availability, and lack of compatibility
with existing C extension modules.&nbsp; The advantages of Java over C
as an implementation language include portability of binary executables,
object-orientation in the implementation language to match object-orientation
in Python, true garbage collection, run-time exceptions instead of segmentation
faults, and the ability to automatically generate wrapper code for arbitrary
Java libraries.
<H2>
1. Why Java?</H2>
The current implementation of Python in C is a fairly large and complicated
software system. Does Java provide enough advantages when compared to the
current implementation in C for it to be worth this significant reimplementation
effort?&nbsp; The simplest answer to this question is that the tidal wave
of popularity Java has been enjoying recently is a good enough reason to
be interested in building a Python system that is 100% pure Java and can
capitalize on Java's rise to fame.&nbsp; In addition, Java has a number
of significant technical advantages over C, Python's current implementation
language.&nbsp; These include portability, object-orientation, robustness,
and scripting language friendliness.
<H3>
1.1. Portable</H3>
Java programs compile down to portable executable bytecodes that can run
on any computer that supports a Java virtual machine.&nbsp; Unlike ANSI
C, which achieves portability across platforms through recompilation of
source files, Java's portability is available at the level of binary executables.&nbsp;
This means that Java programs can be distributed as binary files that will
run on any platform.&nbsp; While code written purely in Python currently
enjoys this advantage and will run on any machine with a Python interpreter
installed; the wealth of C-based Python extension modules, as well as the
central Python interpreter itself, are only portable to multiple platforms
after a (sometimes painful) recompilation of the C source.

<P>Another important aspect of Java's portability is the rich set of portable
APIs that SUN is defining for the language. They provide standard interfaces
for everything from database access to 3d graphics; and work uniformly
on any platform that supports Java.&nbsp; More detailed information on
these current and planned APIs can be found at JavaSoft's web pages [1].
<H3>
1.2. Object-Oriented</H3>
Java is an object-oriented language with the basic features of encapsulation,
polymorphism, and inheritance.&nbsp; This makes it a much better fit to
Python's object oriented nature than C.&nbsp; The existing implementations
of Python's built-in types in C all show the contortions required to represent
classes in a non-object oriented language.&nbsp; Built-in types can be
much more cleanly represented in Java by taking advantages of the language's
own object oriented features.

<P>One of the standard advantages cited for object-oriented languages is
the ability to easily achieve code reuse.&nbsp; I take advantage of this
in my implementation by having all Python objects inherit from a single
PyObject base class.&nbsp; Furthermore, all of the sequence types (list,
tuple, string) inherit from a single PySequence base class.

<P>The current implementation of Python in C has an unfortunate asymmetry
between built-in types and Python-defined classes.&nbsp; One aspect of
this asymmetry is that users cannot write classes that inherit from built-in
types such as lists and dictionaries.&nbsp; Another aspect of the current
asymmetry is that instances of built-in types don't have __dict__'s that
can be inspected to determine their attributes and methods.&nbsp; A large
part of the reason for this asymmetry comes from the implementation difficulties
of creating "real" classes in a non-object-oriented language like C.&nbsp;
In my implementation of Python in Java, it is relatively easy to make this
asymmetry go away by taking advantages of the object-oriented design of
Java for implementing the built-in types.
<H3>
1.3. Robust</H3>
No Java program will ever segmentation fault.&nbsp; Instead it will throw
a catchable runtime exception.&nbsp; This is a significant improvement
over C where uncatchable, destructive errors occur all too frequently at
runtime.&nbsp; It needs to be said that bugs in the Java VM can still lead
to segmentation faults, but it's a lot easier to debug a single VM than
all of the libraries and applications you'll want to run on top of it.&nbsp;
Python programmers are used to this level of robustness in their Python
code.&nbsp; However, the frequent inclusion of C-based extension modules
in Python leads to these runtime segmentation faults appearing nonetheless.

<P>A key part of Java's robustness is its use of true garbage collection.&nbsp;
My Python implementation on top of Java is able to take advantage of this
capability in the underlying language and eliminates the need to maintain
reference counts on Python objects.&nbsp; This makes writing extension
modules significantly easier as there is no longer a need to keep track
of the reference counts on Python objects.&nbsp; It also provides true
garbage collection to Python code so that circular references no longer
lead to memory leaks.
<H3>
1.4. Glue Language Friendly</H3>
One of Python's primary uses is as a glue language to work with existing
libraries written in C.&nbsp; The ease with which users can generate Python
wrappers around these existing C-based libraries is a frequently cited
strength of Python.&nbsp; Nonetheless, these wrappers require a significant
amount of hand-coding to make the C libraries available to Python.

<P>Java's design is friendlier to glue languages than C.&nbsp; Both Java's
type safety and the existence of a reflection API make it reasonably easy
to automatically generate wrappers that allow Python programmers to access
Java packages.&nbsp; The ability to do this without any hand-coding of
wrapper modules (as is currently the case in C) makes it trivial for Python
programmers to use any Java package.
<BR>As an example of how Java's type safety makes it possible to automatically
generate wrappers for a given function call, consider the following C function
declaration:
<CENTER><PRE>void foo(int *a, int n);</PRE></CENTER>
This function signature has at least three interpretations, each of which
is expressed uniquely in Java.&nbsp; The lack of pointers in Java, and
the fact that all arrays have their length implicitly included are what
make the Java specification of these signatures unique.
<UL>
<LI>
A function of a single array of length n (the length is encoded in the
array in Java).</LI>

<UL>
<PRE>void foo(int a[]);</PRE>
</UL>

<LI>
A function of a single int ‘n' returning a new int ‘a'.</LI>

<UL>
<PRE>int foo(int n);</PRE>
</UL>

<LI>
A function of two ints ‘n' and ‘a', returning a new int in ‘a'.</LI>

<UL>
<PRE>int foo(int a, int n);</PRE>
</UL>
</UL>
Beyond this clear model of what any Java type represents, Java also provides
a reflection API to allow glue languages to discover all of the methods
and fields implemented by a given class and to dynamically access them
at runtime.
<H2>
2. Implementing Python in/on Java</H2>
My implementation of Python in Java consists of three key components.&nbsp;
The first is a parser and lexer for the Python grammar.&nbsp; These are
pure Java code generated by the JavaCC parser generator [2] freely available
from Sun.&nbsp; They are similar to Python's C-code parser and lexer.&nbsp;
When run on a Python source file the parser generates a collection of Java
objects representing the parser tree.

<P>The second component of the system is a compiler written entirely in
Python that traverses this parse tree to output actual Java bytecodes.&nbsp;
(Notice that I'm already taking advantage of the power of this system here
as I use a compiler written in Python to traverse a parse tree consisting
of Java objects produced by a Java-based parser).&nbsp; This is different
from the current Python implementation, which outputs its own private bytecode
format.&nbsp; By producing Java bytecodes, I'm coming closer to what in
the C-world would be accomplished by directly generating machine code.&nbsp;
But this is a portable machine code that will run on any Java platform.

<P>The third component of my implementation of Python in Java is a collection
of Java-based support classes.&nbsp; These classes provide the implementations
for the basic Python objects (lists, integers, instances, classes, …) as
well as implementations of handy functions like "print" and "import".&nbsp;
The functionality of Python's current virtual machine is split between
these support classes and Java's own virtual machine.
<H3>
2.1. Compiling Python to Java Bytecodes</H3>
Both the Python and Java languages compile to a portable bytecode format.&nbsp;
The virtual machines for both of these languages are stack-based.&nbsp;
Stack-based architectures seem to be the norm for virtual machines, while
most native microprocessors are instead register-based machines.&nbsp;
Unlike the Python virtual machine which was designed purely for running
Python code, the Java VM was built to be able to run code from a wide variety
of languages.&nbsp; I am aware of compiler projects (in various stages
of completion) for Scheme, TCL, BASIC, Rexx, Python (described in this
paper), ADA and C that target the Java VM.

<P>Let's take a look at how a very simple expression is currently compiled
to Python bytecodes by the Python compiler.&nbsp; To keep things as simple
as possible, we'll consider the expression "2+2".
<UL><B>Python Bytecodes for 2+2</B>
<BR><TT>0 LOAD_CONST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0 (2)</TT>
<BR><TT>3 LOAD_CONST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0 (2)</TT>
<BR><TT>6 BINARY_ADD</TT></UL>
This simple expression generates three Python bytecodes.&nbsp; The first
two load the Python integer object "2" on to the operand stack.&nbsp; The
final opcode adds the top two elements on the stack together.&nbsp; It
does this using Python's conventions for dynamic method invocation.

<P>The Java bytecodes for this same operation look surprisingly similar:
<UL><B>Java Bytecodes for 2+2</B>
<BR><TT>0 iconst_2</TT>
<BR><TT>1 iconst_2</TT>
<BR><TT>2 iadd</TT></UL>
The first two opcodes push the integer "2" on to the operand stack, and
the third opcode adds the top two operands together.

<P>Despite the apparent similarities between these two bits of assembly
code, the underlying mechanics are in fact quite different.&nbsp; The Java
machine is working on literal integer values.&nbsp; It actually pushes
the 32-bit binary value 0x00000002 on to the stack to represent the integer
2.&nbsp; The Python code, on the other hand, is manipulating Python integer
objects.&nbsp; What it pushes on to the stack is not a raw integer literal,
but a pointer to a corresponding integer object.

<P>Furthermore, Python's BINARY_ADD opcode is very different from Java's
iadd.&nbsp; The Python opcode dynamically invokes the appropriate code
to add the top two objects on the stack together based on their run-time
types.&nbsp; The Java opcode on the other hand requires that its two operands
are literal 32-bit integers.&nbsp; This difference captures much of the
inherent differences between Python's highly interactive/dynamic nature,
and Java's static but high-performance design.

<P>Despite these deep underlying differences, the Java VM has facilities
to implement Python's dynamic model with minimal overhead.&nbsp; While
Java's integers are inappropriate for representing Python's integers, Java
objects can readily represent Python integers (and all other Python objects).&nbsp;
And while Java's built-in add methods can not implement Python's dynamic
method lookup, Java method invocation can be used to achieve the same effects.&nbsp;
Making these changes, we see how the Python semantics for "2+2" can be
compiled to Java bytecodes.
<UL><B>Java Bytecodes for 2+2 with Python's Semantics</B>
<BR>0 getstatic #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// static field _i2
<BR>3 getstatic #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// static field _i2
<BR>5 invokevirtual #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // PyObject.add(LPyObject;)LPyObject;</UL>
This implementation will push a Java object corresponding to the Python
integer "2" on to the top of the stack, and then do that again.&nbsp; The
third opcode will invoke the add method on the top object on the stack,
and it's the responsibility of this method to implement Python's "add"
semantics.
<H3>
2.2. Java Class Hierarchy for Python Types</H3>
In order to make the above bytecodes work, all of the built-in Python types
must be implemented as Java classes.&nbsp; The Java class hierarchy to
implement the core Python types is shown below.
<UL>
<LI>
java.lang.Object</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
PyObject</LI>

<LI>
PyInteger</LI>

<LI>
...</LI>

<LI>
PyDictionary</LI>

<LI>
PySequence</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
PyString</LI>

<LI>
PyList</LI>

<LI>
PyTuple</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
PyClass</LI>

<LI>
PyInstance</LI>

<LI>
PyFrame</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
The names of the classes should be familiar to anybody who has worked with
Python's existing internals.&nbsp; It's unfortunate that these names use
the "Py" prefix that's so necessary in Python's C implementation.&nbsp;
Java has very nice namespace management (similar to the package namespaces
provided in Python 1.5).&nbsp; Unfortunately, every Java program automatically
imports the "java.lang" namespace.&nbsp; This means that the names "Object",
"Class", and "Integer" are already taken in any Java program.

<P>The PyObject class implements all of the basic functionality of Python's
dynamic method invocations.&nbsp; This is very similar to Python's existing
semantics, though it is simplified because of increased similarities between
built-in types and Python defined classes.
<H3>
2.3. A More Complicated Example</H3>
The actual implementation of my Python to Java bytecode translator performs
a direct translation from Python to Java bytecodes.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
almost all of what it does can be viewed conceptually as a translation
of Python to Java.&nbsp; Since it tends to be easier to read Java source
code than Java VM assembly code, I'll present the next few examples that
way.&nbsp; The translation from Java source code to Java bytecodes is generally
fairly straightforward.&nbsp; Remember that the following examples of Java
source code are for illustrative purposes only.&nbsp; My Python in Java
system never generates Java source files, but only executable Java bytecodes.

<P>I'm going to show how a very simple Python module is conceptually translated
to a Java module.&nbsp; Table 1 shows both the code for the Python module
and the Java source that corresponds to the Java bytecodes my compiler
actually generates.
<BR>

<BR><TT>18&nbsp;&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>19 }</TT>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Line 1 declares a new Java class.&nbsp; Every Python module is implemented
as exactly one Java class.&nbsp; Each Python module must also implement
the interface PyRunnable which allows the module to be initialized (and
requires the module to implement the "run" method as shown here).

<P>Lines 3-6 define the constant pool for this Python module as static
fields on the Java class.&nbsp; Each of these static fields holds a Java
object which corresponds to some primitive Python constant.

<P>Lines 7-18 define the single method of this Java class.&nbsp; This is
the method that is invoked when the module "foo" is imported under Python.&nbsp;
This method receives a PyFrame object corresponding to the Python stack
frame in which the module should execute.&nbsp; This object is used to
hold all Python local and global variables (no effort has been made to
take advantage of Java's local variables as they have sufficiently different
semantics than Python's dynamic counterparts as to make this difficult).

<P>Line 9 shows how this frame object is used to execute simple variable
assignment.&nbsp; The local variable whose name corresponds to the python
string "x" is assigned to the Python integer constant 2.

<P>Line 11 shows a slightly more interesting example.&nbsp; Here, the lookup
of the local variable x should be obvious.&nbsp; It is added to the Python
constant integer 2 using its add method.&nbsp; This "add" method is implemented
in PyObject and handles Python's dynamic method invocation semantics.&nbsp;
Notice also that the Java VM's execution stack is being used to keep track
of the operands in this add operation; and furthermore, the Java VM's garbage
collection is being held responsible for handling memory management so
that no reference count management is needed.

<P>Line 13 is a simple import statement.&nbsp; All of the interesting work
is hidden here in the implementation of Py.importModule().&nbsp; I don't
want to go into the details of this here, I am just using it as a convenient
device to get an object into my name space for which I can get and set
attributes.

<P>Line 15 is an example of setting an attribute on an object.&nbsp; Those
familiar with Python's "__" special methods should recognize the "__setattr__"
method immediately.&nbsp; This method works just like the Python version
except that it operates on Java objects (some of which might represent
PyInstance objects).

<P>Finally, line 17 prints out the attribute that has just been set.&nbsp;
Once again, "__getattr__" works just like the corresponding Python special
method.
<H3>
2.4. An Example With Function Definition</H3>
As one final example, I will show how a simple Python module that defines
a new Python function can be converted to Java.&nbsp; This example is somewhat
complicated because I have tried to make it complete.&nbsp; If you're not
really interested in the low level details of how Python in Java is implemented,
I'd highly recommend skiping this example.&nbsp; The original Python source
for this module, as well as its theoretical translation to Java source
are shown in Table 2.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Line 1 declares the "doubleit" Java class corresponding to the Python
module just as in the previous example.&nbsp; In addition to the PyRunnable
interface which was described previously, this class also supports the
PyFunctionTable interface which is used to support Python defined functions.&nbsp;
More details on how this is accomplished are described below.

<P>Lines 3-6 define the constant pool for this module just as in the previous
example.

<P>Lines 7-11 are used to add a Python code object to the constant pool.&nbsp;
The arguments passed to this new code object are (in order): number of
arguments, an array of variable names (including arguments), the filename
of the module which defines this code, the name of the code, whether the
code supports *args, whether it supports **keywords, an object that can
be used to lookup the actual code to be invoked, and an integer index to
be passed to that object to indicate which function to actually call.&nbsp;
The details of these last two parameters will be explained later.

<P>Lines 12-15 define the actual Java code to be invoked for the "double"
Python function.&nbsp; This function will be called when the _xdouble code
object is called.&nbsp; Line 14 shows a small optimization in this code
that is equivalent to Python's FAST_LOCALS optimization.&nbsp; The local
variable "x" in this function is looked up by a numeric index into the
frame variable table rather than by name.&nbsp; This optimization offers
a significant speedup for local variable references in both Python in C
and my own Python in Java.

<P>Lines 16-23 define the required method for the PyFunctionTable interface.&nbsp;
The goal of this method (and this interface) is to fake the effects that
are typically realized in C using pointers to functions.&nbsp; The PyRunnable
interface is the simplest solution to the problem that Java does not allow
references to function to be passed around.&nbsp; Any class that implements
this interface can be passed around and used as a function pointer to the
"run" method contained by that class.

<P>Instead of using the PyFunctionTable interface, I could instead generate
a new Java class file for every function pointer that I wanted, but this
is very wasteful of space.&nbsp; Using the PyFunctionTable interface, each
module contains methods for every code object that it contains.&nbsp; It
also contains this "call_function" method that will lookup the appropriate
function to call based on an integer index.&nbsp; This allows a single
Java class to support as many Python code objects as desired.

<P>Finally, lines 24-31 define the run method that is used to invoke the
top-level code in this module.&nbsp; This is equivalent to the same method
as in the previous example.

<P>Line 26 creates a new Python function object which is initialized with
the current globals dictionary, no default arguments, and the appropriate
Python code object from the constant pool.

<P>Finally, line 30 prints out the result of calling this new function
object with the single Python integer 2.&nbsp; The arguments to the function
call are passed as a Java array of PyObjects.&nbsp; This allows the function
to be called with an arbitrary number of arguments despite the fact that
Java doesn't support anything like Python's "*args".
<H2>
3. Integration of Python and Java</H2>
Compiling Python to Java bytecodes is only a part of the picture for making
Python and Java work together.&nbsp; What is also needed are seamless mechanisms
to allow Python code to use Java libraries (see related work by Kevin Butler
[5] and Douglas Cunningham [4]) and to allow Python code to be called from
Java (I think this is going to be really hard to achieve with any generality
in the other two approaches to embedding Java in Python).

<P>Applets provide a good example of where this sort of seamless bi-directional
integration is required.&nbsp; In Table 3 I show the Python source code
for a simple wokring "Hello World" applet. It will run in any web browser
that supports JDK1.1.&nbsp; At the moment this includes SUN's HotJava browser,
and patched versions of Internet Explorer 3.1 and Netscape Navigator 4.0.&nbsp;
Before the end of 1997 all major web browsers should support JDK 1.1 without
patches.

<P>This example shows how Python classes can create instances of Java classes,
and invoke methods on these instances.&nbsp; It also shows how a Python
class can subclass from a Java class and override specific methods.

<BR>Line 1 imports the "java" package.&nbsp; This package is the root of
the standard Java class hierarchy.&nbsp; If I didn't want to use fully
qualified names, I could have written things like "from java.applet import
Applet" instead.&nbsp; The new support for packages in Python 1.5 makes
it so that this syntax and semantics for importing Java packages is virtually
equivalent to that used for Python packages.

<P>Line 2 creates a new Python class "HelloApplet" which subclasses the
Java class, "java.applet.Applet".&nbsp; The ability of Python classes to
subclass Java classes is a key part of the seamless integration of the
two languages.&nbsp; This also means that Python in Java code can subclass
from any built-in class including Python lists and dictionaries (no more
UserList.py).

<P>Line 3 implements the "paint" method for this applet object.&nbsp; This
overrides the standard implementation of this method in the Java superclass.&nbsp;
It accepts a single argument (other than itself) which is a Java graphics
object.

<P>Lines 4-8 invoke various methods on this graphic object in order to
draw a huge garish magenta on black "Hello World" within the browser where
it is running.&nbsp; All of the methods called here are Java methods, implemented
in the java.awt package.&nbsp; In line 5, one is called with a Java object
corresponding to the color black.&nbsp; In line 6, the "fill3DRect" method
is called with five Python integers.&nbsp;&nbsp; These Python Objects are
coerced to the appropriate Java primitive integers when making the call.

<P>Line 6 shows the creation of a new instance of the java.awt.Font class.&nbsp;
The syntax for instance creation is exactly like that used when creating
a new instance of a Python class.&nbsp; The Python objects which are the
arguments are appropriately coerced to Java objects or primitives when
the class is actually instantiated.

4. Separation of Python and Java VM's</H2>
By choosing to implement Python in Java by running Java bytecodes directly
on top of the Java virtual machine, I am able to utilize the machinery
of the Java VM to handle many tasks that the current Python VM in C must
deal with itself.

<P>The Java VM takes care of memory management using a true garbage collection
scheme.&nbsp; This means that there is no need to deal with reference counting
at run-time for code that is implemented in Python or Java.

<P>The Java VM handles the immediate operation stack.&nbsp; This means
that I don't need to worry about managing a stack of intermediate results.&nbsp;
It also handles multi-threading.

<P>Finally, the Java VM deals with much of the problem of exception handling.&nbsp;
Every try/except clause in Python is implemented as a try/catch clause
at the level of the Java VM.&nbsp; The one great limitation is that the
Java machinery must trap all exceptions and then subsequent support code
is used to determine the actual type of the Python exception thrown and
invoke the appropriate except clause, or reraise the exception to the next
stack frame.

<P>There are a number of additional function performed by the standard
Python VM that do not map nicely onto the Java VM.&nbsp; These functions
are implemented by Java support code that is a key part of my Python in
Java system.

<P>As mentioned above, part of this support code is needed for handling
specific Python exceptions.&nbsp; It also includes support code for dynamic
method invocation.

<P>Finally, this support code must manage a separate Python call frame
stack.&nbsp; A key part of managing the call frame stack is handling local
and global variable access.&nbsp; This is also done in the support code.&nbsp;
It is unfortunate that the Java VM's ability to manipulate local variables
can't be used here instead.&nbsp; There seem to be a small number of unresolved
issues related to the very dynamic nature of namespaces in Python that
make it much easier to just implement my own local variables.
<H2>
5. Current Status of Implementation</H2>
I can compile reasonably complicated Python modules directly to Java bytecodes.&nbsp;
The resulting code runs about half as fast as under the standard Python
1.4 in C distribution.&nbsp; In addition, the Java ".class" file is about
twice as large as the corresponding Python ".pyc" file.&nbsp; On the pystone
benchmark found in the standard Python distribution, I found that my Python
in Java implementation obtains 941 PyStones running on a 200MHz PentiumPro
under Windows NT 4.0.&nbsp; The standard Python 1.4 implementation in C
obtains 1595 PyStones running on the same machine under the same operating
system.&nbsp; The Python in Java implementation is about 1.7 times slower
than the standard Python in C.&nbsp; I timed the Java implementation running
under Microsoft's second beta release of their JDK1.1 compliant virtual
machine with JIT compilation enabled.&nbsp; This is the fastest Java VM
that I could find at the time of writing this paper.

6. Conclusions</H2>

<H3>
6.1. Python in Java's Disadvantages</H3>
My new implementation of Python in Java has a number of disadvantages when
compared to the existing Python in C system.&nbsp; Some of these are the
frequently cited disadvantages of Java vs. C.&nbsp; It is not compatible
with existing Python modules that have been written in C.&nbsp; Java's
portability is great, but there are still a number of platforms where it
is either not supported at all, or only supported poorly.&nbsp; Finally,
this system is slower than the current C-based implementation (by a factor
of 1.7).

<P>The portability and speed problems are likely to go away as people continue
to work on improving the Java runtime systems.&nbsp; As anecdotal evidence,
the first Java VM that I used for my experiments in April 1997 is about
2.5 times slower than the Java VM I'm using today (September 1997).&nbsp;
As far as portability is concerned, the Kaffe project [5] provides a free
portable implementation of the Java VM that is relatively easy to get running
on a wide variety of platforms.

<P>The problem of backwards compatibility is more difficult to address.&nbsp;
Personally, I feel that Python in Java has enough advantages for module
writers (garbage collection, true exceptions, object-orientation, portable
binaries, …) that they will be happy to reimplement their systems.&nbsp;
Whether this is true or not remains to be seen.
<H3>
6.2. Python in Java's Advantages</H3>
Using Java as the underlying systems language for Python has a number of
advantages over the current implementation of Python in C.&nbsp; First
and foremost of these in my mind is the opportunity to ride the Java popularity
wave and let Python code run everywhere there's a Java VM.&nbsp; It also
makes the rich set of portable Java API's available from within Python.

<P>There is also a nice collection of technical reasons why Java is a superior
implementation language for Python than C.&nbsp; These include Java's binary
portability, thread-safety, object-orientation, true exceptions, garbage
collection, and friendliness to glue languages. More questions need to
be answered before I can make a convincing argument that Python 2.0 should
be implemented in Java rather than C.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I think that Java
offers many advantages for Python as both an implementation language and
a widely available run-time platform.
