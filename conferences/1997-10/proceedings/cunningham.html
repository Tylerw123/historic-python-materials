<FONT SIZE="2">The two language approach to software development has 
been investigated by several language designers. The primary hypothesis 
of such an approach being that both strong compile-time type checking 
and loose run-time type checking are desirable in evolutionary software 
development. Java is a static type-checked language which offers 
performance, robustness and modularity as such, while Python is a 
run-time type-checked language which offers rapid prototyping, dynamic 
run-time modification, and delayed evaluation. The premise of this work 
is that evolutionary software development can be more efficient using 
both languages together than using either language alone.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE="2">The Java Python Interface (JPI) is an interface between 
Java and Python which allows the two languages to interoperate through 
dynamic message lookup and the conversion and exchange of objects and 
exceptions. Through the JPI, Python can be used as a scripting language 
for Java-from a Python interpreter one can prototype AWT components and 
even create bindings which call Python code. In addition, the JPI can 
be used to add user level Python scripting to Java programs. </FONT><BR>

1 Introduction </H3>
<P>
Over the last decade the use and value of prototypes in design, both in 
software and other engineering disciplines, has been investigated and 
discussed by researchers [Budde92] [Krogh96]. Evolutionary software 
development, which consists of the rapid prototyping of new components 
and their evolution into hardened components [Budde92], offers many 
benefits to the object-oriented software development process [Cox91]. 
Included among these benefits is the ability to address rapidly 
changing software requirements. In addition, the efficiency gained from 
user-centered design, which consists of constant user feedback 
impacting the software design, has received significant attention 
recently [Landauer95]. </P>
<P>
The requirements of user-centered and evolutionary software development 
cycles share many similarities but also include conflicting aspects. 
User-centered development demands the ability to rapidly add features, 
modify behavior, and create new user interface components. Evolutionary 
software development can have these same requirements but also requires 
the creation of well-defined modules and stable, efficient code. </P>
<P>
Clean module interfaces, compile-time error checking, and performance 
make statically typed languages such as C++ [Stroustrup87] and Java 
[Arnold96] useful for the creation of hardened components. Meanwhile, 
rapid prototyping, fast compile-test-debug cycles, and high programming 
flexibility make dynamically typed languages such as Python [Watters96] 
and Tcl [Ousterhout94] appropriate for the rapid creation of prototype 
components. </P>
<P>
Ousterhout argues that a two language approach proves both feasible and 
practical for software development [Ousterhout97]. For example, 
languages such as Python and Tcl provide consistent interfaces to C to 
allow developers to move performance critical methods and procedures 
into C without modification of the calling code. In addition, the 
dynamic language can be used to make calls to and exchange data between 
existing C or C++ modules. </P>
<P>
The Java Python Interface (JPI) attempts to merge the strengths of two 
languages which are very similar in syntax and function. The purpose of 
the JPI is two fold: 1) allow for the simultaneous development of 
prototype components in Python and hardened components in Java, and 2) 
allow for the addition of user-level Python scripting to Java programs. </P>
<P>
This paper will describe the motivation of such an approach, and then 
focus on the technical details of the JPI. </P>
<H3>
2 Motivation </H3>
<P>
Design practices in software engineering vary widely from usage of the 
waterfall model to the evolutionary development model. In addition, 
explorations into user- centered design in software engineering have 
increased over the last few years [Karat96]. Although a unified 
definition of user-centered design has not been reached, Karat offers 
elements of one. Karat draws on Gould's four high level principles of 
good design as a partial definition of user-centered design. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE="2">The principles include early and continual focus on 
users (suggesting that this involves direct user involvement in the 
design process), early and continual evaluation, iterative design and 
development, and integrated (whole system) design. [Karat96]</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In order to carry out design in this fashion the development 
environment must allow for the co- existence of stable modules with 
well-specified interfaces and newly prototyped modules with still- 
changing interfaces. In addition, the ability to quickly prototype new 
features, particularly in a running system, with a fast 
compile-test-debug cycle is required, while at the same time, the 
ability to statically determine code validity is necessary. </P>
<H4>
2.1 Two Languages </H4>
<P>
Supporting the above requirements well requires a language which can 
support both static and dynamic components at the same time. Currently, 
the most widely used development languages do not allow for this type 
of flexibility. Instead, developers are often left to choose a language 
which does not satisfy all of the necessary requirements. 
Unfortunately, choosing a single language leaves many pitfalls in the 
development process. </P>
<P>
If developers choose to use a statically typed language they often 
encounter problems in the early prototyping and development phases. 
First, they may begin to define programming module interfaces 
prematurely which can cause delays for other developers when modules 
are redefined and require recompilation of part or all of the system. 
Second, they are forced to engage in long compile-test-debug cycles due 
to the longer compilation times of static languages and the need to 
restart the program and recreate the state under which the error 
occurred. Third, determining the cause of an error can be difficult due 
to the inability to directly query the running program for information 
other than through the use of a debugger. Fourth, it is difficult to 
debug part of an incomplete program since the compiler will not allow 
the program to run until all of the compile-time errors are corrected. 
While a static language offers many benefits, these limitations often 
make it difficult to rapidly prototype all or part of an application. </P>
<P>
On the other hand, if developers choose to use a dynamically typed 
language they often encounter problems in the latter phases of 
development when performance, scalability, and maintainability are 
crucial. First, they may end up not defining module interfaces well 
since the language often will not require the strict specification of 
the interface to a module. Second, they often encounter performance 
problems when writing computationally intensive code and as a result 
spend a great deal of time optimizing code. Third, they suffer scale 
problems related to CPU and memory usage when a system becomes large. 
Fourth, the detection of all coding errors, except syntactical, is 
delayed until the actual line of code containing the error is executed 
- meaning completely exhaustive tests must be written in order to check 
the validity of code. Despite the benefits of a highly dynamic 
language, these limitations make it difficult to maintain a large piece 
of software. </P>
<P>
Fortunately, alternatives exist to choosing either a static or dynamic 
language. Languages such as Python and Tcl, offer the option of using 
both a dynamic component, the language itself, and a static component, 
C. Therefore, a developer can use a language such as Python to 
prototype and debug new code and then reimplement that code in C for 
performance and scalability. This two language approach to software 
development offers many benefits over using a single language. 
Programmers can prototype new features, work out their logic, and fix 
errors without the need to engage in a long compile-test-debug cycle. 
Once code logic has been established and verified, the code can then be 
moved into the static language to gain speed and robustness and force 
the creation of a well-defined interface. </P>
<H4>
2.2 Java and Python </H4>
<P>
The use of two languages does not immediately solve the challenges 
facing a development team. Often, using two languages can have as many 
problems as using a single language. </P>
<P>
For several years, the <EM>n</EM>-dim project at Carnegie Mellon 
University has investigated the two language approach with an object 
system called BOS [Dutoit96]. BOS, standing for Basic Object System, 
allows for the prototyping of code in an interpreted language called 
stitch and the hardening of code in C, much like Python and Tcl. Our 
experiences have shown that the main drawback of this approach is that 
moving code into C is a costly effort since it requires a complete 
reimplementation of the code and often the logic. As a result, 
developers typically take the first step of prototyping code in the 
dynamic language and then neglect the needed step of reimplementing the 
code in the static language despite the performance and scalability 
gains. Recently, tools such as SWIG [Beazley97] make this process 
easier for languages including Perl, Python, and Tcl, but they still 
require significant work on the part of the programmer. </P>
<P>
Python and Java share many common features [Masse96] - they are both 
object-oriented, support garbage collection, provide object-based 
exception handling, guarantee memory safety, and have a similar syntax. 
As a result, using them together in the two language approach offers a 
potential solution to the barrier of converting prototype code to 
hardened code. Given the ability to seamlessly communicate between the 
two languages, one could maintain different parts of a program in each 
language. Classes prototyped in Python could easily be converted to 
Java classes, but at the same time, particular methods, such as those 
undergoing a lot of rapid change, could be kept in Python. The 
similarities of Python and Java allow for the transition of code from 
one language to the other to be extremely easy and even offer the 
possibility of complete automation. </P>
<P>
The Java Python Interface (JPI), provides a mechanism for this type of 
communication. Messages can be sent to Java objects from Python and 
vice-versa, argument conversions are performed between the two 
languages, objects from one language can `exist' in the memory space of 
the other, and exceptions thrown from one language can be caught in the 
other. The following section describes the JPI in more detail and gives 
examples of how it can be used to satisfy the requirements of both 
rapid prototyping and code hardening in software development. </P>
<H3>
3 The JPI Overview </H3>
<P>
The JPI is an interface between Java and Python. It allows for the 
dynamic manipulation of Java objects through the use of Python and 
vice-versa. By writing Python code one can program using existing Java 
classes. In addition, the syntactical similarities between Python and 
Java are great enough that the conversion of prototyped Python code to 
hardened Java code is very easy and can even be largely automated. </P>
<P>
The JPI consists of a simple interface between the two languages, but 
at the same time, it is quite powerful. An example of the use of the 
JPI is the Python class shown in Example&nbsp;1 which creates a Java 
AWT button and prints `Hello World!' when it is clicked. This section 
describes the implementation of the JPI. </P>

3.1 Basics </H4>
<P>
The JPI consists of a Python C module (java), a Python C type 
(JavaObject), and three simple Java classes (Python, PyObject, and 
PyEventListener). </P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    The `java' module implements the simple functionality of looking up 
    Java classes through a `findClass' method. 
    <LI>
    The `JavaObject' type wraps an actual Java object in a Python C type. 
    Any messages sent to a `JavaObject' are answered by dynamically finding 
    the appropriate method defined for the Java object. 
    <LI>
    The `Python' class implements the functionality of sending code to 
    Python to be evaluated and allows the getting and setting of attributes 
    in Python's main module. This class also implements the method for 
    dynamically finding and invoking Java methods. 
    <LI>
    The PyObject class wraps an actual Python object in a Java object. 
    Messages can be sent to the Python object by invoking the `send' method 
    with a message name and arguments. 
    <LI>
    The `PyEventListener' class is provided to listen for AWT events. 
</UL>
<P>
In addition, the `java' module and `Python' class handle the object 
conversions described below. </P>
<H4>
3.2 Java Classes </H4>
<P>
To create a Java instance a program must first obtain a class to 
instantiate. This is done using the `findClass' method of the `java' 
module. It is useful to assign classes to variables for more convenient 
use. Once a class is obtained, the `new' message will invoke a 
constructor matching the arguments provided. Example&nbsp;2 
demonstrates this. </P>

In addition, the static fields and methods of a class can be accessed 
through this handle to a Java class. As Example&nbsp;3 shows, sending a 
message to a Java class from Python looks almost exactly as it does in 
Java.</P>

<H4>
3.3 Java Instance Methods and Variables </H4>
<P>
Messages are sent to Java through a dynamic message lookup scheme. The 
`JavaObject' Python C type, which wraps a Java object, contains a 
global reference, provided by the JNI, to the actual Java object. When 
a message is sent to a `JavaObject' a dynamic message lookup ensues in 
order to find out if the actual Java object has a method with the 
correct name and argument types. If an appropriate method is found it 
is invoked. If no method is found, then the lookup proceeds to search 
for an instance variable with the correct name and argument type. If a 
matching variable is found, then the variable is either set (if one 
argument was provided) or its contents retrieved (if no argument was 
provided). If no variable is found or more than one argument was sent, 
then an exception is thrown. </P>
<P>
Example&nbsp;4 shows Python code which both invokes a method and gets 
the value of a variable. Unfortunately, as the example demonstrates, 
accessing a variable is not as seamless as sending messages since it 
requires an extraneous set of parenthesis. The reason for this is that 
the `JavaObject' type uses the `getattr' function to answer any 
messages sent to the object. Since the `getattr' function is not given 
the information of whether the user is attempting to invoke a method or 
get the contents of a variable, it is not possible to know whether a 
method or variable lookup should be done. Presumably this information 
is available to Python, but it is not passed to `getattr'. An 
alternative solution to forcing the use of parentheses is to have the 
variable lookup take precedence over the method lookup, but the 
behavior would still not be ideal. </P>

&gt;&gt;&gt; num = o.length() 

# Send the `elems' message to get the 
# contents of the `elems' variable

</CENTER>
<P>
Likewise, the Java class, PyObject, wraps an actual Python object. An 
instance of PyObject contains a pointer to the actual Python object and 
a `send' method is provided to send a message to the Python object. 
Clearly, the code to send a message to Python is not as clean. This is 
because Java does not provide any mechanism for answering any message 
sent to an object such as Python's `getattr'. Example&nbsp;5 gives the 
implementation of a Java method called `reverseRange' which takes a 
Python object as an argument and sends it the `reverse' message. </P>

3.4 Object Conversions </H4>
<P>
Sending messages without arguments or without receiving results would 
be quite limiting. Therefore, an integral aspect of the JPI is the 
passing of objects between Java and Python through type conversions.

and the type conversions from Python to Java are listed in Table&nbsp;2. </P>

The argument conversion code will convert objects in both directions 
when used in an argument list or when returning results. If an object 
can not be converted to a primitive type it will be converted to either 
a PyObject or a JavaObject depending on the direction of conversion. An 
exception to this rule is the `new' primitive of the `java' C module 
which always returns a JavaObject. The code in Example&nbsp;6 
demonstrates several object conversions. </P>

The JPI attempts to support object conversions well in both directions, 
but there are no guarantees that a problematic situation can not arise. 
As illustrated in Example&nbsp;7, a Java class could define two methods 
with the same name and arguments similar enough that a message sent 
from Python could potentially be answered by both methods. Currently, 
the choice is arbitrary - the first method it finds will be the one 
selected. There is, of course a way around this as the example also

3.5 Exception Handling </H4>
<P>
Exceptions are handled by the JPI by converting an exception back and 
forth between a Python exception and a Java exception as it passes up 
the call stack. The programmer can catch the exception in either of the 
languages. Currently though, the exception handling mechanism loses 
information about the original exception when it is converted between 
languages. So an exception occurring when sending a message to Java 
will result in a general Exception object being thrown. Due to this 
drawback, the JPI prints out the exception information just before 
conversion so that the programmer can see the actual exception that 
occurred. Future work will improve upon this such that in either 
language the actual exception which was thrown will be passed back and 
forth. The current and future behavior are shown in Example&nbsp;8. </P>

3.6 Other Implementation Details </H4>
<P>
<B>Classes and Interfaces.</B> In order to have a Python class 
implement a Java interface or subclass a specific class, a Java class 
doing so must be created which then forwards messages to a Python 
object. The PyEventListener class is an example of this. The 
PyEventListener class implements all of the AWT event listener 
interfaces. Its constructor requires a PyObject to which it will 
forward calls to the interface methods. The PyEventListener serves 
merely as a custom wrapper for a PyObject to satisfy the interface 
requirements of methods which demand some type of event listener. 
Example&nbsp;1 gives an example of how the PyEventListener can be used. </P>
<P>
<B>The (Fake) Interpreter.</B> The JPI provides its own interpreter 
because difficulties were encountered when trying to run the Python 
interpreter from C. This fake interpreter merely reads input and sends 
it to Python for the real interpretation, but as a result, the behavior 
of the interpreter does not exactly match that of Python. Multi- line 
expressions are finished as soon as a blank line is entered, and 
results are not printed automatically, the `print' command must be 
used. </P>
<P>
<B>Reserved Words.</B> There is also a problem when sending messages 
which correspond to Python reserved words, e.g., print. This is because 
the Python parser looks for the reserved words and immediately 
generates an error if the reserved word is not being used properly. 
Therefore, trying to send a message to a Java object which matches a 
reserved word will result in a syntax error. The work around for this 
is to use the `send' method defined on `JavaObject' to by-pass the 
Python parser. The `send' method takes the message to be sent as its 
first argument. </P>
<H3>
4 Other Approaches </H3>
<P>
Other approaches to building software out of both static and dynamic 
components exist-a language supporting both static and dynamic modules 
could be written, different languages could be chosen for integration, 
and the languages could be integrated in different ways. </P>
<P>
As described in Section 2, the <EM>n</EM>-dim group has experimented 
with a prototype-based object-oriented system, BOS, which satisfies 
many of the requirements outlined above [Dutoit96]. For example, BOS 
allows for method and variable declarations to be typed or untyped. 
Although BOS currently does not perform any static type-checking, this 
feature could be added to BOS to verify code validity when types are 
provided. In this way, developers could opt to leave out typing 
information when in the prototyping phase and later add typing 
information when in the code- hardening phase. </P>
<P>
One of the goals of the JPI was to have a system which consisted of 
commercially supported, or near commercially supported, languages. 
Section 2 described the reasons for choosing Python and Java. The 
similarities were great enough that an integration of the two could be 
much cleaner than any other alternatives. For example, if the attempt 
was to integrate Python and C++, then garbage collection issues would 
certainly be an obstacle. Python could not maintain a handle to a C++ 
object without concern of when the C++ object is destroyed. With Java, 
Python can simply call a JNI function which establishes a global 
reference to the Java object. This prevents the Java object from being 
garbage collected even when Python is the only reference holder. 
Likewise, when Java holds a reference to a Python object the object's 
reference counter can be incremented to prevent garbage collection. In 
both cases, the referring wrapper object can release its hold on the 
object when the wrapper object is itself garbage collected. </P>
<P>
Another approach to building a system with both dynamic and static 
components is through the use of an interfacing tool such as CORBA or 
ILU. These tools allow the programmer to specify the interface of a 
module such that the module can be used from a different language, by 
another program, or even by a program running on a different machine. 
While this offers flexibility with regards to the number of possible 
ways in which the module can be used, it requires the rigid 
specification of a module interface. In fact, CORBA and ILU are 
orthogonal to the JPI and do not conflict with, but instead augment, 
its usefulness. </P>
<P>
Finally, this is not the only project attempting to integrate Python 
and Java. Kevin Butler from Brigham Young University has implemented a 
package called PyJava which also provides an integration between Java 
and Python. Although the functionality is quite similar, the 
development methods employed are very different. While a full 
comparison of the two approaches is beyond the scope of this paper, the 
most notable difference in functionality is that PyJava currently only 
allows for Python to call Java and not vice-versa. </P>
<H3>
5 Future Directions </H3>
<P>
This integration of Java and Python is not yet complete and still 
reveals many seams. Improvements can be made to the JPI and changes to 
Java and Python could also improve the quality of the integration. </P>
<P>
First, the JPI needs more work in the areas of exception handling and 
threads. Improvements to these two aspects of the JPI are currently 
being investigated. </P>
<P>
Second, if Python provided a way of finding out the pretenses under 
which `getattr' was being called, then the extraneous set of 
parenthesis, mentioned in Section 3, could be disposed of when 
accessing Java variables. Also, if the Python interpreter could be 
modified such that it does not generate an error when a reserved word 
is used as a message name, then code calling a Java method would not 
need to use the `send' primitive described above. Both of these changes 
would make code written in Python closer to its Java equivalent. </P>
<P>
Third, there are changes to Java that would allow for better access to 
Java objects and a symmetric way of calling Python. A privileged code 
status would allow certain code modules (e.g. a debugger, JPI, etc.) to 
access private and protected methods and variables. This feature is 
mentioned in the Java documentation but has yet to be included in a 
release. Also, a Java feature similar to Python's `getattr' would allow 
for a symmetric way of calling Python. For example, Java could reserve 
a method which will get invoked when no other method can answer the 
message. This feature could be explicitly turned on so as not to damage 
the benefits of compilation. Hence, this method could be added to the 
PyObject class so that any message sent to it from Java could be 
forwarded to Python. </P>
<P>
The JPI is still under development. Features to tighten the match 
between Java and Python are being investigated, while bugs and porting 
issues are being addressed as well. </P>
<H3>
6 Conclusions </H3>
<P>
The JPI has been used extensively by the author. Despite the described 
shortcomings it has proven very valuable. Code can be prototyped very 
quickly in Python and, once it works properly, moved to Java. Programs 
can be interactively debugged such that the state of a running program 
can be queried and modified to find the cause of a bug and the 
potential corrections for it. Graphical interfaces can be prototyped 
using the Java AWT and modifications can be made directly from the 
Python command line such that the programmer can experiment with layout 
and appearance without needing to recompile and rerun the program. User 
level scripts can be added to programs such that run-time 
customizations can be made to programs. </P>
<P>
Finally, due to the many similarities between Java and Python, the JPI 
is able to support the two language approach to software development in 
an intuitive manner. For example, in one particular case a LoginDialog 
class was prototyped in Python while establishing the look and feel and 
then reimplemented in Java once completed. The dynamic nature of Python 
allowed for many iterations of the look and feel to be experimented 
with over the course of a day. Once the final design was determined, 
the LoginDialog class was reimplemented in Java. The reimplementation 
consisted primarily of a syntax conversion and was completed in less 
than an hour. </P>
