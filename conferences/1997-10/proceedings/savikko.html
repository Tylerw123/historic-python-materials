The choice of implementation language affects the use of design
patterns. Naturally some languages are better applicable for different
tasks 
than others. Each language has its own set of strengths and
weaknesses. In 
this paper we implement some of the better known design patterns in
Python, whose object model is quite different from that of 
conventional object-oriented languages. Thus we acquire some
insight into the
generality of the patterns in the context of Python.

1 Introduction</A>
</H1>

In software engineering the term pattern describes a proven
solution to a common problem in a specific context. Patterns can be
divided into three
different categories depending on their level of abstraction and
implementation language independency: architectural patterns, design
patterns and idioms [<A
 HREF="#posa">BMR+96</A>]. In this work we concentrate on the
latter two categories: design patterns as they are
described in  what is known as the G<SMALL>ANG</SMALL>
<SMALL>OF</SMALL> F<SMALL>OUR</SMALL> -book (G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F for 
short) [<A
 HREF="#gof">GHJV95</A>] and Python language
idioms.
The patterns are not only microarchitectural models but also  
 useful as a
common design vocabulary among software engineers. The overall
architecture of the system and related design decisions can be
explained by giving a set of patterns used. While new patterns do emerge
 the G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F still remains as the definite reference on
design patterns. For this reason it is important to introduce these
patterns, the notions and the theory behind them and their applicability
to Python community.
<P>
G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F is divided into three parts and each part describes
the patterns 
related to the theme of the part. The themes describe the purpose of
the patterns. Creational patterns address object instantiation
issues. Structural patterns concentrate on object composition and
their relations in the runtime object structures. Whereas the
structural patterns describe the layout of the object system, the
behavioral patterns focus on the internal dynamics and object
interaction in the system.
<P>
While the design patterns strive to be language independent they still
require - at least implicitly - some support from the implementation
language and especially from its object model. In G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F
the languages 
of choice are C++ and Smalltalk. Therefore the availability of 
access specifiers and static member functions (class methods) are
assumed. The aim here is to look at some G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F patterns
and try to implement them in a language (Python) whose object model 
is radically different from that of C+By doing this we can draw
some conclusions about the generality of G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F patterns
and what accommodations - if any - are necessary when applying them
in Python programming environment. And while operating on the
programming language level we look at some Python idioms and how they
can help implement G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F patterns.
<P>
We begin with a short description of Python as an object language in
Section <A HREF="#sec:python">2</A> and then move on to the selected
patterns. We have chosen one pattern from each category of
G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F: 
Singleton (creational, Section <A
HREF="#sec:singleton">3</A>), Chain of Responsibility
(behavioral, Section <A HREF="#sec:chain">4</A>) and Proxy
(structural, Section 
<A HREF="#sec:proxy">5</A>). In Section <A HREF="#sec:conclusions">6</A> we sum up the
lessons learned and further discuss the generality of our
implementation solutions.

2 Python</A>
</H1>

To put it briefly Python is a weakly and dynamically typed interpreted
language. These attributes combined with a large assortment of
extensions make Python a natural choice for different
scripting tasks, for example CGI scripts. Python is also mentioned
as a strong candidate for a steering language [<A
 HREF="#dubois">Dub96</A>] because
of its interpreted and expressive nature. From
the object-oriented programming perspective Python has all the
necessary features and more: classes, multiple inheritance,
operator overloading. One peculiar aspect of Python's object
model is its negligence towards data hiding. For the time being Python's
policy can be described as ``encapsulation by courtesy'' meaning
that a class instance assumes that none of its clients tries to break
the class interface and manipulate instance attributes
directly. However, the situation is not totally grim; language release 1.4
implements privacy using name mangling. This solution is
considered experimental before  a better conceived encapsulation
mechanism is provided [<A
 HREF="#python:tutorial">vR96</A>].
<P>
The other remarkable thing about Python objects is that they are not
merely instances of their classes; their structures can change in
runtime. This level of flexibility combined with the ability of the
instance to 
trap attribute access lays a foundation for various Python idioms. On
the other hand it also requires some restraint from the programmer,
because overly ``dynamic'' code can be very difficult to understand and
maintain. This applies also to the Python programs in general; while
the language makes it easy to achieve relatively complex tasks, it
does not relieve us programmers from the demands of the sound design
principles.

3 Singleton</A>
</H1>

Singleton pattern provides a mechanism to limit the number of the
instances of the class 
to one. Thus the same object is always shared by different parts of
the code. Singleton can be seen as a more elegant solution to global
variable because actual data is hidden behind Singleton class
interface. First we look at how Singleton can be implemented in C++ and then provide a Python solution with the same features.

<P>
Our minimal Singleton class definition (Fig.&nbsp;<A
HREF="#fig:singleton.h">1</A>) has only 
one public member: class method <TT>Handle</TT>. Defined interface is not
very useful as such, because the client can do nothing with the
instance, but now we concentrate only on the techniques that ensure
only one Singleton instance at a time.
<P>
Private constructor forbids creating an object outside the class. Thus
the clients of the class have to rely on the static member function
<TT>Handle</TT>: it either creates a new instance or returns a
reference to the Singleton object (Fig.&nbsp;<A
HREF="#fig:Handle.cc">2</A>).

<P>
Because Python has no private constructors we have to find some
other way to prevent instantiations. Our approach in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:singleton.py">3</A> is to raise an
exception if the Singleton 
object is already instantiated (private class attribute
<TT>__single</TT> is other than <TT>None</TT>). The exception
object is the Singleton 
instance! The downside of this solution is that it requires the
clients to be prepared for the exception. It could also be argued that
using exceptions for other purposes than error handling is not very
good style. These concerns can be avoided to some extent by providing
a similar <TT>Handle</TT> function than in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:Handle.cc">2</A>. This function
hides the unorthodox 
instantiation 
details and returns a reference to the Singleton object
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:Handle.py">4</A>).

<P>
Due to Python's type system the code in Figure&nbsp;<A
HREF="#fig:Handle.py">4</A> 
works for the whole Singleton hierarchy. Consider the following situation:
class <TT>Singleton</TT> has subclasses <TT>Child</TT> and
<TT>Junior</TT> as shown in Figure&nbsp;<A
HREF="#fig:children">5</A>. Because there 
exists an <EM>is-a</EM>  relationship between base class and a subclass
there can be only one instance of the whole
hierarchy. <TT>Singleton</TT> or <TT>Junior</TT> instance can be
created with <TT>Handle</TT> function. The constructor of the
<TT>Child</TT> class takes one - explicit - argument so the
instantiation must be done with the direct constructor call or
a specialized handle function. The following code
demonstrates the Singleton hierarchy:
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; child = Child( 'Monty' )
&gt;&gt;&gt; junior = Handle( Junior )
&gt;&gt;&gt; junior.name()
'Monty'
&gt;&gt;&gt; single = Handle()
&gt;&gt;&gt; single
&lt;Child instance at d1d88&gt;  
</pre>
Sometimes it is convenient to decide at runtime which Singleton class
is instantiated. G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F proposes a registry-based approach where the client
consults a special registry object, which contains a list of
name-Singleton pairs. By requesting a Singleton by-name, the client
receives a reference to the corresponding Singleton instance. Updating
the registry may be problematic: Who does register a Singleton? If it
is Singleton instance itself (in its constructor) then every possible
Singleton must be instantiated in order to be accessible by the
clients of the registry!
<P>
Fortunately simplification is possible through Python's namespace
concepts. Local and 
global scopes - or rather their dictionary representations - can be
accessed via <TT>locals</TT> and <TT>globals</TT> functions. For
example one can instantiate <TT>Junior</TT>:
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = 'Junior'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sclass = globals()[name]
&gt;&gt;&gt; junior = Handle( sclass )
&gt;&gt;&gt; junior
&lt;Junior instance at d1bd8&gt;
</pre>
Of course, now the registry (scope dictionary) contains much more
than only Singleton-related information, so there is always a
risk that a client treats some function as a Singleton
class. This unhappy coincidence can be avoided to some extent by using some
naming convention for Singletons. A specific registry object is a good
idea even in Python environment. Clients should not access scope
dictionaries directly but through the registry. Now the registry can
detect and deny any Singleton lookups that are illegal according to
the agreed 
naming convention. Again, this approach depends on the courtesy of
the clients.
<P>
Perhaps the most foolproof and straightforward solution is to do the
registration on the module level. Each module that contains Singleton
classes should also contain initialization statements that register
the class names with the registry module. Because modules are
initialized only for the first time they are imported, a client gains
access to the registry by importing the registry module. In a way a
module can be thought of as a rudimentary Singleton. One advantage of
this explicit registration approach is the option to implement as
sophisticated a registry database as needed. In other words we can store
more information about Singletons than just the class names, for
example module names, base classes, different constraints and so
on. The registry can also offer different services for Singleton
lookup, statistics and debugging, for example.

4 Chain of Responsibility</A>
</H1>

The motivation behind Chain of Responsibility pattern is to create a
system that can serve different requests in a hierarchical manner. In
other words if an object that is a part of the system does not know how
to respond to the given request it passes it along the object
tree. As the name implies, each object along the route of the request
can take the responsibility and serve the request.
<P>
Chain of Responsibility pattern is often used in the context of
graphical user interfaces 
where one widget may contain several other widgets. As the windowing
environment generates events the widgets either handle them or pass
them to their parent widget (container), as in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:chain">6</A>.

<P>
If <TT>MsgText</TT> receives an event its <TT>Handle</TT> method
either handles the event or calls the <TT>Handle</TT> method of the
<TT>SendDialog</TT> and so on. <TT>MsgText</TT> need not know
which object - if any - will handle the event; the hierarchy does not
have to be fixed. In some other context an <TT>MsgText</TT> object
would behave similarly and so hierarchies can be modified at
runtime. The hierarchy need not necessarily be tree-like. One
variation of the pattern could be a system where objects create a
ring-like structure and some or all of the objects could act as  clients as
well as part of the chain.
<P>
Implementing the pattern in C++ is relatively straightforward: in our
GUI example each object would be a subclass of the <TT>Widget</TT>
class defined in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:widget.h">7</A>. While this is also a feasible
solution in Python, it does not use Python's object model to
the full potential. A more dynamic and flexible approach is to use the
techniques introduced in Guido van Rossum's Command Dispatch 
pattern [<A
 HREF="#python:dispatch">vR97</A>]: dynamic attribute lookup and addition.

<P>
With Python we need not restrict ourselves to the predefined set of
methods as we did with with <TT>Widget</TT> hierarchy: the only way to
handle the event was by <TT>Handle</TT> call. The idea behind the
Command Dispatch pattern is to check at runtime whether the object has
a proper method or not. Our <TT>Widget</TT> class in Python
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:widget.py">8</A>) provides its subclasses
with this dispatch 
mechanism. The use of the separate event class (<TT>Event</TT> in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:widget.py">8</A>) emphasizes the fact that
various kinds of 
information can be transmitted through the chain. Only the
<TT>name</TT> attribute is assumed. 
Because new attributes
can be added dynamically and new methods can be added through
subclassing, the interface of the base <TT>Event</TT> class can be
kept to a minimum.

When an event object is passed to <TT>Handle</TT> method, one of the

<DT>1.
<DD>Each event has an associated name. If widget has a corresponding
method (named <TT>Handle_<EM>eventname</EM> </TT>), it is executed
<DT>2.
<DD>If the object is not the last one in the chain, it passes the event
  object to its parent
<DT>3.
<DD>If the object has a default handler for all kinds of events
  (<TT>HandleDefault</TT> method) it is invoked if the object is the
  last possible handler. Because <TT>HandleDefault</TT> should always
  be available only on the end of the chain, it is not necessary or even
  sensible to have it in the interface of the base class.

Some Python classes for our GUI example are implemented in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:example">9</A>. The following code builds the chain and
demonstrates its use:
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mw = MainWindow()
&gt;&gt;&gt; sd = SendDialog( mw )
&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = MsgText( sd )
&gt;&gt;&gt; edown = Event( 'down' )

SendDialog: paint
&gt;&gt;&gt; eodd = Event( 'odd' )
&gt;&gt;&gt; msg.Handle( eodd )
Default: odd
</pre>
One curious aspect of our solution is that an event handler need not
necessarily be a method; it can also be a function object. This allows
the programmer to add new event handlers to existing 
objects instead of creating new classes through inheritance. Due to
the Python's scoping rules an event function cannot access the
attributes of its container object. However, because the event
function itself is an attribute it can be deleted. In other words
event functions provide means of creating temporary event handlers to
an existing Chain of Responsibility hierarchy. A simple example:
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def PrintName( e ):
...     print 'Name: ' + e.name
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; sd.Handle_odd = PrintName
&gt;&gt;&gt; msg.Handle( eodd )

5 Proxy</A>
</H1>

    <P>
From the point of view of the object-oriented design the ability
to trap attribute 
access provides some new solutions to old problems. A good example is
the Proxy pattern, which is used when an object has to be shielded from
its clients. There may be a number of reasons for this: reference
counting, different levels of access rights, lazy evaluation of the
state of the object and so on. The runtime object structure for the
pattern is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:proxy">10</A>.

<strong>Figure 10.</strong> Runtime object structure

</table>
<P>
The client does not need to know that it is not accessing the real
object (<TT>Subject</TT>) directly. In other words the proxy 
substitutes for the real thing. In C++ this would
mean that both the proxy and the subject class have a common base
class. In Python the same effect can be achieved by masquerading the
proxy instance as the subject by providing the same method
interface. Our proxy class in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:proxy.py">11</A> is based on
near-universal <TT>Wrapper</TT> class [<A
 HREF="#python:tutorial">vR96</A>]. As
such the <TT>Proxy</TT> class is only a trivial wrapper for any
subject. However, its main function is to serve as a base class for more
specific proxy implementations. Because the <TT>__gettattr__</TT>
method is called only as the last resort the proxy can handle a
subject method differently by ``overloading'' it in the proxy class. 
Let us consider the following situation: we access an instance of class
<TT>RGB</TT> (Fig. <A HREF="#fig:rgb">12</A>) first directly, then using a generic
Proxy instance as a wrapper and finally via <TT>NoBlueProxy</TT> instance
(Fig. <A HREF="#fig:noblueproxy">13</A>):

<P>
While Python provides some mechanisms that are usually implemented
with the Proxy pattern (for example simple reference counting) the
pattern is still highly applicable to the Python community.
An excellent example is Daniel
Larsson's RemoteCall package [<A
 HREF="#larsson">Lar97</A>], which provides a simple
mechanism for distributed applications. One of the key concepts in the
system is the role of agents, which are client-side representations of
the server-side objects - in other words, proxies. The history of the
package also
demonstrates a noteworthy aspect of patterns in general: the author
recognized that he had applied a pattern only <EM>after</EM>  the
implementation. 
<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
6 Conclusions</A>
</H1>

G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F patterns and Python can benefit from each other. While Python
lacks some features that G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F assumes, it is not impossible to build
pattern implementations that work like their G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F counterparts. Our
Singleton implementation substituted private constructors with an
exception mechanism and a class method with a regular function but the
underlying pattern is still clearly Singleton. It is important to note
the difference between a pattern and its implementation. In Singleton
our main focus was to maintain the features of the pattern as
described in G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F. This leads to a solution that is probably too
obscure to be recognized as a Python pattern. A more intuitive - and
perhaps Pythonlike - solution would be to abandon any encapsulation
issues and simply provide a factory function for the Singleton
instance [<A
 HREF="#python:lundh_singleton">Lun97</A>].
<P>
The use of Python as an implementation language can also enhance the
pattern. The flexible and dynamic nature of the language provides a
good basis for a number of different and elegant solutions. Our Chain of Responsibility implementation makes the pattern more dynamic by implementing it
with Command Dispatch pattern, which takes advantage of Python's
runtime capabilities. These capabilities include runtime attribute
lookup and addition. In other words the instances of the same class
need not necessarily have identical structure and attribute access
can be monitored and trapped. These mechanisms provide a fairly elegant
way to implement various generic classes as in our Proxy
implementation.
<P>
We have chosen three patterns to emphasize the issues discussed,
but we are also confident that other G<SMALL>O</SMALL>F patterns can also be implemented
in Python, and with similar results. While the patterns might
end up with added dynamic and flexible features after the process, this
would not necessarily erode 
the usability and recognizability of the patterns. The familiarity and
the order provided by the use of patterns may offer major benefits for
various Python object systems and frameworks.
