<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The Molecular Modeling Toolkit is a library of Python modules and
C extension modules that provides an object-oriented description of
molecular systems and an implementation of the most common modeling
techniques. It is one of the first large scientific applications
implemented in Python. This article presents some aspects of its
design and implementation that are typical for scientific applications
in general. Its aim is to demonstrate by example how scientific
computing can benefit from Python, and to show how common problems can
be solved.


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Scientific computing is inherently experimental and exploratory.
Although a large number of established algorithms and techniques are
used again and again, the specific combination of techniques needed to
solve a particular problem is usually unique and not precisely known
at the start of a project.

<p>Typically, a scientist using computational techniques has a
collection of various programs that deal with some part of the problem
at hand. Some of these programs are widely used and come with
documentation and perhaps even technical support. Others have been
written by a student - who has graduated long ago - for a specific
task, and their suitability and reliability may be questionable. All
these programs have their own conventions, input and output file
formats, and idiosyncrasies.  In practice, computational scientists
spend a significant amount of time with finding and testing the
programs they need and dealing with file conversion and other
interfacing problems.

<p>The combination of the individual computational steps occurs
manually (interactively) or with simple shell scripts. Some of the
programs used may have a built-in scripting language, but these
scripting languages are never sufficient to deal with all aspects of a
problem, and they certainly do not allow the integration of other
independently written programs. Sometimes there is no other way left
than to write a specialized program in a "real" programming language,
in practice Fortran or C.

<p>Another problem with scientific programs is that they lack even the
most elementary elements of user-friendly design. This is partly due
to lack of awareness of the problem; many scientists have never seen a
user-friendly program. Also, most programs are quite old, dating back
to the mainframe or even the punched-card era. In addition, the
predominant scientific programming language, Fortran-77, makes
user-friendly programming difficult, if not impossible. For example,
binary files produced by a Fortran program are inherently machine and
compiler dependent, which makes data exchange difficult even if
everyone uses the same programs.

<p>This article will show how Python can help to improve this
situation. The example presented, molecular modeling, is not an
untypical scientific application. Many of the design decisions and
techniques can be applied to other scientific domains. The library
described here, the Molecular Modeling Toolkit (from now on MMTK), is
freely available <a href="#ref_mmtk">[1]</a>.

<h2>Molecular Modeling</h2>

<p>The term <em>molecular modeling</em> is used to describe the study
of molecules and molecular systems by means of computer models. The
most common model for a molecule consists of a set of atoms,
considered to be a point mass having a position in space and possibly
other properties. All the atoms in a molecular system interact with
each other; these interactions are described by the <em>interaction
energy</em>, which is a function of the positions and properties of
the atoms. The interaction energy is the central quantity in molecular
modeling, and constructing an appropriate function is one of the
major problems. There are many "recipes" for calculating the
interaction energy, ranging from very simple functions of interatomic
distances to the solution of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation (the
fundamental equation of quantum mechanics) for all electrons of all
atoms in the system. These recipes are called <em>force fields</em>.

<p>Like many other scientific applications, molecular modeling relies
heavily on a few computationally intensive algorithms. An example is
<em>energy minimization</em>, i.e. finding a configuration of atoms
that is a local or global minimum of the (high-dimensional)
interaction energy function; this operation can take several days or
even weeks of CPU time for large systems. Another example is
<em>normal mode analysis</em>, which essentially involves the
calculation of the matrix of second derivatives of the interaction
energy function and the diagonalization of this matrix. Even
calculating the interaction energy itself requires a substantial
amount of CPU time for large systems.

<p>However, modelers spend most of their time on other operations,
which are to a high degree interactive. The first important step is
the definition of the system to be studied, i.e. deciding which
molecules should participate, what a reasonable configuration looks
like, and which force field should be used. Then an appropriate
technique for obtaining the required information must be selected or
developed. All this requires a large set of fundamental operations:
reading in external (e.g. experimental) data, calculating, comparing,
and modifying geometrical quantities, visualization, modifying force
fields, energy minimization, etc. The few time-consuming operations
mentioned above are in fact nothing special, they only take longer to
complete.  Nevertheless, traditional modeling programs are designed
around these few operations, ignoring the others altogether or
implementing them as an afterthought.

<p>It should also be mentioned that molecular modeling is far from a
mature discipline. Although some generally accepted techniques exist,
they are not sufficient for studying many of the large systems that
are of practical relevance. New methods and techniques are being
developed continuously. Therefore molecular modeling software ought
to be designed for extensibility, but traditional packages have proved
to be unsatisfactory in this respect.

<h2>Overview of MMTK</h2>

<p>Most molecular modeling programs are written around the few
time-consuming algorithms and adapt their data models to them.  A
typical representation of a molecular system is a list of atoms plus
an implicit force field (few programs can handle more than one force
field). The molecular structure disappears, although it would be
very useful for the user. Instead of referring to, for example,
"the side chain of histidine-34 in the regulatory chain" (a very
meaningful description for a biochemist), you might have to say
"the atoms in group 270 whose names are not C, N, O or H".

<p>In contrast, MMTK is based on an object-oriented description of
molecular systems, with classes matching the real objects that
chemists talk about: atoms, functional groups, molecules, and
complexes. In addition there are object types describing force fields,
universes (the "environments" of molecular systems), "machines" acting
on a universe (e.g. energy minimizers), and the results of some
operations (dynamical trajectories, normal modes etc.). Most of these
objects are familiar to chemists, and new users have no problems
understanding them, although it takes a while to get rid of old habits
and use the object-oriented description efficiently.

<p>As the name implies, MMTK is not a program, but a library. It does
not embed Python as a scripting language, but extends Python with new
modules. MMTK users have the freedom to choose and combine what they
need from MMTK and from other libraries. This permits explorative work
in a way that with traditional tools would be prohibitively
complicated. For example, non-standard visualization tasks can be
handled by a short Python program using MMTK, a VRML module, and an
external VRML viewer. With traditional tools, the effort to extract
and convert the data would be prohibitive.

<p>The idea of building scientific code in the form of libraries that
are tied together by an interpreter is not new. The Basis Code
Development System developed at LLNL <a href="#ref_basis">[2]</a>, for
example, provides a scripting language extendable in Fortran, and Tcl
has been used in some scientific applications. However, such
approaches never received the attention they deserved, and scripting
languages are by design limited in scope. Python, in contrast, is
powerful enough to be used for most of the library itself.

<p>MMTK is a rather large library, consisting (in version 1.0b2) of 36
Python modules and four C modules. It would be very difficult for
users to remember what is defined in which module, especially since
the modules define many functions and classes for internal use that
are not of direct utility to the MMTK user. Therefore MMTK contains
one more module which does nothing but import all the user-relevant
definitions from the other modules. To the user, MMTK appears thus as
one module. The disadvantage of this approach is that all modules
are loaded when the "master" module is imported, even if they are
not needed. As MMTK grows, it might become necessary to introduce
some more of these "meta-modules".

<p>In summary, the implementation of MMTK as a Python library
offers two essential advantages over traditional modeling
programs: an object-oriented description fully accessible to the
end user, and the freedom to combine MMTK with other libraries.
Other scientific applications would equally benefit from this
approach.

<h2>The "chemical object" classes</h2>

<p>The central part of MMTK - and the part in which it offers the most
advantages compared to traditional modeling programs - is the
representation of chemical objects (atoms, molecules, etc.)  and
complete systems. A common base class, <tt>GroupOfAtoms</tt>, defines
the operations that are defined solely in terms of atomic properties
and positions. This includes all geometrical operations (finding the
center of mass and moment of inertia, moving the object in several
ways, superposing two configurations, etc.), but also visualization.

<p>A subclass is <tt>ChemicalObject</tt>, which in turn has the
subclasses <tt>Atom</tt> and <tt>CompositeChemicalObject</tt>.  The
latter has the subclasses <tt>Group</tt>, <tt>Molecule</tt>, and
<tt>Complex</tt>. Complexes can contain molecules and atoms, molecules
can contains groups and atoms, and groups can also contain groups and
atoms, but groups cannot be used outside molecule definitions.

<p>Other subclasses of <tt>GroupOfAtoms</tt> are <tt>Collection</tt>,
representing any collection of chemical objects, and <tt>Universe</tt>,
representing a complete system with a force field and perhaps an
outer environment.

<p>A less obvious choice is how to represent different types of
molecules, for example water molecules and chloroform molecules.
Molecules differ only in their composition, not in the operations
defined for them. One could define a subclass for each molecule,
redefining only the initialization method. But molecules can change
identity during chemical reactions, whereas class instances cannot
change their class. Therefore all molecules must be instances of
the same class.

<p>MMTK implements a prototype-based molecule factory. It maintains a
database of atom types, group types, molecule types, and complex
types. Each database entry is an object with a structure almost
identical to that of the ultimate chemical object instance. Creating a
real instance involves a procedure similar to that used in Python's
copy module: the attributes of the prototype are examined and
analogous attributes in the instance are created. Attributes that are
identical for each molecule of a certain kind (e.g. force field
parameters) are not copied, but referenced from the new instance.

<p>The disadvantage of this system is that the instantiation procedure
is slow, having to examine all attributes again each time an instance
is created. It is not uncommon to create thousands of molecules of the
same kind in a system, so efficiency matters.  It is planned to
replace the instantiation system in the future by a compiled-code
version: when a prototype is instantiated for the first time, it
creates a custom instantiation function as a text string, compiles it
using the <tt>exec</tt> function, and stores the function object for
later use. Such a technique, which relies on the dynamic nature of
Python, may be applicable to prototype-based object factories in
general.

<p>The database is not part of the MMTK source code, since it must
frequently be extended by end users, who should not have to understand
the instantiation system. Instead, users write each definition as a
separate text file and place it in a directory which is searched by
MMTK. The definition files are tiny Python programs that are executed
with the <tt>execfile</tt> command in a context defined by a special
Python module. In addition to the obvious advantage of not requiring
a special parser, the use of tiny Python programs for definition and
configuration files makes life easier for the user, who does not have
to remember another syntax.

<p>Finally it should be mentioned that the prototype database is not
the only way to create chemical objects in MMTK. For chain molecules
like proteins, whose building blocks are a small number of functional
groups, it would be too much of an effort to write a database entry
whose structure would be the same for all cases. Such molecules are
described by specialized subclasses that define appropriate
constructors and implement additional operations that would not make
sense for general molecules.


<h2>Numerically intensive algorithms</h2>

<p>It was mentioned earlier that molecular modeling requires a few
computationally expensive operations. Not all of these operations are
of the "simple-operation-on-large-dataset" type, so they cannot be
implemented efficiently in terms of the array operations from the
numerics extension (aka NumPy) <a href="#ref_numpy">[3]</a>. They must
therefore be implemented in C modules.

<p>However, a C module dealing with instances of Python classes is
hardly faster than Python code itself. A low-level representation of
the data (chemical objects etc.) is therefore necessary. This
low-level representation is subject to two conditions:
<ul>
<li>The efficiency of the C code must have top priority. Some of the
    data (e.g. the atomic configuration) is accessed very frequently.
    Requiring even as little as a C function call for each data access
    would be disastrous. Therefore the data must be stored in typical
    C data structures.
<li>The information in the low-level data structures should not be
    repeated in the high-level structures. That would be a waste of
    memory and an important source of errors. The high-level data
    structures should instead use references to the low-level ones.
</ul>

<p>One possibility would be to define several specialized C extension
types. But writing an extension type involves a substantial effort,
and unless the data is to be used directly in application programs,
this effort is not justified. However, the array type provided by the
numerics extension fits that description nicely. Its internal data
structure is a C array, so C code can access it efficiently. On the
other hand, Python code can easily create and store references to any
part of the data. This approach keeps the C modules simple at the cost
of some added complexity in the Python code, where it is easier to
handle.

<p>MMTK uses almost only arrays in the interface between Python and C
code. An example is the storage of atomic configurations. At the C
level, all positions of all atoms in a universe are stored in a single
array for efficiency.  At the Python level, each atom has an attribute
<tt>position</tt> whose value is an instance of the class
<tt>Vector</tt>. Class <tt>Vector</tt> stores its internal data (three
coordinates) in an array - and this array is created by indexing from
the full configuration array. This ensures consistency between the two
system descriptions.

<p>Three of the four C modules in MMTK cover force field evaluation,
energy minimization, and computation of dynamical trajectories. The
fourth one provides base services for algorithms that create
trajectories, i.e. it provides specialized I/O operations. One other
computationally expensive operation, normal mode analysis, is
implemented in Python using the <tt>LinearAlgebra</tt> module of
NumPy, which ultimately calls LAPACK, a highly optimized linear
algebra library written in Fortran.

<p>An important design goal in MMTK was the separation of force field
evaluation and the algorithms that call it (such as energy
minimization).  Since these operations are closely intertwined at
execution time, it is tempting to implement them together in one
module. In fact, this is what most modeling programs do. However,
this creates problems for later extensions: new force fields might not
work correctly with all force field users, and new algorithms using
force field information might not obtain the correct force field.

<p>A consequence of the decision to separate these tasks into
different modules is that MMTK's C modules must communicate among each
other in an efficient way. This is different from the majority of C
modules, which provide functions and object types to be used from
Python code only. It is, however, typical for many large scientific
applications.

<p>If the modules were statically linked to the Python interpreter,
they could simply provide a C API in the form of a header file to be
included by client modules, much like the C API for built-in Python
types. However, the possibility of compiling C modules into shared
library files is a very convenient one, especially for code
development. But shared libraries can't simply call each other's
functions, at least not under all operating systems. A solution
is provided by the CObject data type, introduced with Python 1.4.
CObjects simply wrap a C pointer into a Python object. The C
modules in MMTK create an array of <tt>void *</tt> in which they
store the addresses of the type objects and C functions they
want to export. The address of this array is put into a CObject,
which is assigned to the name <tt>_C_API</tt> in the module's
name space. Another C module wishing to use this C API imports
the module and takes the address of the pointer array from the
CObject. A header file that comes with the imported module defines
the C API functions as macros in terms of the array entries.

<p>It must be stressed that once the initial setup phase is finished,
the time-critical algorithms in MMTK execute as pure C code on typical
C data structures, with absolutely no overhead caused by the Python
interpreter or the use of Python data types. The overhead caused by
the use of pointer indirection for function calls across modules is
negligible, and not uncommon even in pure C programs (not to mention
C++). The only disadvantage compared to a straightforward C
implementation is a more complex design.

<h2>Storing and retrieving data</h2>

<p>The two main reasons to store data in permanent files, other than
interchanging data with other people or programs, are storing the state
of a system after interactive manipulations for later reuse and
storing the result of a time-consuming operation that would be too
costly to repeat. In molecular modeling, the objects that must
be stored frequently are
<ul>
<li>complete universes
<li>atomic configurations for a universe
<li>trajectories (i.e. sequences of configurations and other data)
<li>normal modes
</ul>

<p>In MMTK, everything except trajectories is saved and retrieved
using the standard Python pickle module. This is easy and sufficiently
efficient, and generates portable files. However, the resulting files
are unnecessarily large, because they contain much detailed information
that could easily be regenerated instead of loaded. This is a special
problem for configurations and normal modes. Since these objects
contain a reference to the universe for which they were generated, the
whole universe is saved too. It would be nice to store a universe only
once, and then be able to store configurations and normal modes in
separate files containing just a reference to the universe file. This
is in principle doable with the pickle module, but many details are
not yet resolved. It may be preferable to switch to a different
storage method.

<p>Trajectories are different in that they can become much larger than
computer memory. They have to be created directly in disk files, and
read in piecewise, which would be difficult to arrange with the pickle
module. In addition, the creation of trajectories must be efficient,
both in CPU time and in disk space usage. Therefore MMTK uses the
netCDF file format <a href="#ref_netcdf">[4]</a> for its
trajectories. The netCDF format is portable between machines and
operating systems, and an efficient free library is available to read
and write the files from C and Fortran programs. A Python interface
module is available which lets Python programs access netCDF variables
much like NumPy arrays <a href="#ref_netcdfmodule">[5]</a>.

<p>Since trajectories are not written in pickle format, they do not
automatically contain a description of the universe they belong to.
Such a description is desirable both to allow verification when a
trajectory is opened again for reading, and to make the trajectory
fully self-describing, i.e. to allow analysis of a trajectory without
needing additional files. One possibility would be to store a pickle
string in the file, but CPU time, memory, and disk space use would be
substantial. Instead a minimal description of the universe is stored
in a special string format. This string can be executed in the context
of a special module to construct a universe which matches the original
one in structure (i.e. contains the same molecules), but not
necessarily in other features that are irrelevant for the
interpretation of the trajectory. Construction and reinterpretation of
this string format are very fast, and it is much smaller than a full
pickle representation. It might be possible to implement a general
library module for storing and retrieving objects in such a format.
It would require more support from the classes that use it, but offer
efficiency in return.


<h2>MMTK in practice</h2>

<p>Although MMTK is still young and does not have a large user base,
it has been used successfully for real research problems, mostly for
analyzing data from experiments or simulations performed with other
programs. Some of these analyses would have been prohibitively
complicated using traditional tools.

<p>The most important advantage is the easy integration with other
Python modules and external programs for which Python interface
modules exist (e.g. visualization and plotting programs). Examples of
non-standard visualization tasks that were made easy by MMTK (plus a
VRML viewer) are a charge visualization realized by color-coding atoms
according to their charge, and "static" trajectory visualization by
lines indicating the paths of selected atoms.

<p>Another advantage is the ease of using MMTK interactively.
Since the bare Python interpreter is not very convenient for longer
interactive sessions, it is recommended to use either Emacs with
Python mode or the Tk-based GUI package PTUI <a href="#ref_ptui">[6]</a>.
The combination with PTUI again demonstrates the advantage of
MMTK's library approach.

<p>A not yet satisfactorily resolved problem with MMTK is
documentation. There is a user manual which explains the objects and
functions that are of interest to scientists who want to apply the
techniques provided by MMTK. However, scientists involved in the
development and implementation of techniques need much more detailed
information. A developer manual describing the design concepts will
have to be provided, and documentation of individual modules with
comments and documentation strings will have to be improved. In
addition, a tutorial for beginners and people coming from traditional
programs would be highly desirable.

<p>A frequent question is whether MMTK is sufficiently fast for
practical work. The parts written in Python were certainly fast enough
to deal with the analysis of large-scale domain motion in a 26000-atom
protein interactively on a 200 MHz PentiumPro machine running Linux.
The time-critical routines are written entirely in C
and don't use any Python features once they are started, so they are
just as efficient as any other C implementation.

<p>However, there is some overhead caused by the design decision to
give safety, ease of use, and flexibility priority over speed. An
example: For larger systems, a significant amount of CPU time is spent
calculating the distance vectors between atoms. This is a trivial
operation, taking negligible CPU time, but the code to be used depends
on the geometry of the simulated system (e.g. periodic boundary
conditions). Most modeling programs implement a fixed set of allowed
geometries and hard-code the corresponding formulas. MMTK allows new
geometries to be defined without any change to its code, at the cost
of an indirect function call for distance vector calculation, which is
used in the inner loop of the most time-critical calculation.
Eventually a compromise will have to be found, e.g. hard-coding the
most common geometries while still allowing external definitions.

<p>It is difficult to compare the computational efficiency of
different modeling packages, because there are so many variations of
the basic algorithms that affect speed as well as suitability for
various applications. Nevertheless, to give a rough idea of the
performance to be expected, a small real-life application
(equilibration of a system of 300 water molecules with periodic
boundary conditions) was done with both MMTK and CHARMM <a
href="#ref_charmm">[7]</a>. CHARMM is a widely used modeling program
written in Fortran-77 with a reputation for both efficiency and user
frustration. On a PentiumPro computer under Linux, using gcc and g77
for compilation, CHARMM was 2.5 times faster. On the other hand, the
MMTK application consists of seven Python statements and worked
correctly the first time, whereas the CHARMM input file contains 20
statements (in the CHARMM scripting language, which is more
program-oriented than problem-oriented), worked only after an hour of
trial-and-error modification, and required manual editing of the input
geometry file, although it was in a widely used standard format. The
total time required for this mini project was therefore significantly
smaller with MMTK.


<h2>Future developments</h2>

<p>Compared to the popular traditional modeling packages, MMTK is
still lacking many features. This is to be expected, given that MMTK
was written by a single person during about one year as a part-time
project, whereas other programs represent the work of large research
groups during several years. More modeling techniques will be
implemented as the need arises and as time permits. Many established
techniques that are not yet implemented have nevertheless been
considered in the design phase and should therefore not cause
difficulties.

<p>Some possible future developments are particularly interesting
and/or important:
<ul>
<li>Parallelization of the time-critical computational techniques.
    The bookkeeping tasks could be handled in Python, leaving only
    a small part of hand-parallelized C code that could be hard
    to write and test.
<li>Development of GUI-based tools (using Tk) for some standard tasks
    on top of MMTK.
<li>Distributed computing: number crunching on a supercomputer,
    setup and analysis on a workstation. This could be realized via ILU.
<li>Interface modules for dealing with foreign file formats, to
    allow a progressive transition from traditional tools.
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The MMTK project has shown that Python is not only a viable, but a
very appropriate language for scientific computing. It allows to
provide a problem-oriented object-oriented view for the user and an
algorithm-oriented low-level one for routines in C or Fortran that
deal with the numerically intensive parts of the application.

<p>Based on the experience with MMTK, the following recommendations
seem appropriate for scientific Python applications in general:
<ul>
<li>Don't write programs, write libraries.
<li>Design the user-visible objects in a strictly problem-oriented way.
    Don't force the user to deal with low-level implementation details.
<li>Use arrays at the Python-C interface for data that has to be accessed
    from both sides.
<li>Provide a C API via CObjects for C modules that might be
    used directly from other C modules.
<li>As always: don't forget documentation.
</ul>

<p>A potential problem is that following these recommendations
requires extensive experience not only with Python, but also with
C. Most scientists do not have this experience and might not be
willing or able to acquire it.  A much more popular language in
science, in spite of its many shortcomings, is Fortran. Mixed
Fortran-C programming is possible on most machines and would allow the
use of Fortran routines in Python extension modules.  To be attractive
to scientists, however, such an interfacing would have to be doable
with no knowledge of C. Automatic interface generators, similar to
SWIG for C and C++ code <a href="#ref_swig">[8]</a>, are possible, and
indeed have been discussed <a href="#ref_fidl">[9]</a>, but no such
tool is actually available today. It would be an important step to make
Python more attractive to the scientific community.
