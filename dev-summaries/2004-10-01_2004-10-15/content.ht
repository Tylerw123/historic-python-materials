python-dev Summary for 2004-10-01 through 2004-10-15
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is a summary of traffic on the `python-dev mailing list`_ from October 01, 2004 through October 15, 2004.  It is intended to inform the wider Python community of on-going developments on the list.  To comment on anything mentioned here, just post to `comp.lang.python`_ (or email python-list@python.org which is a gateway to the newsgroup) with a subject line mentioning what you are discussing. All python-dev members are interested in seeing ideas discussed by the community, so don't hesitate to take a stance on something.  And if all of this really interests you then get involved and join `python-dev`_!

This is the fiftieth summary written by Brett Cannon (Time for my summary
mid-life crisis).

To contact me, please send email to brett at python.org ; I do not have the time to keep up on comp.lang.python and thus do not always catch follow-ups posted there.

All summaries are archived at http://www.python.org/dev/summary/ .

Please note that this summary is written using reStructuredText_ which can be found at http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html .  Any unfamiliar punctuation is probably markup for reST_ (otherwise it is probably regular expression syntax or a typo =); you can safely ignore it, although I suggest learning reST; it's simple and is accepted for `PEP markup`_ and gives some perks for the HTML output.  Also, because of the wonders of programs that like to reformat text, I cannot guarantee you will be able to run the text version of this summary through Docutils_ as-is unless it is from the `original text file`_.

The in-development version of the documentation for Python can be found at
http://www.python.org/dev/doc/devel/ and should be used when looking up any
documentation on new code; otherwise use the current documentation as found at
http://docs.python.org/ .  PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) are located at http://www.python.org/dev/peps/ .  To view files in the Python CVS online, go to http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/python/ .  Reported bugs and suggested patches can be found at the SourceForge_ project page.

The `Python Software Foundation`_ is the non-profit organization that holds the intellectual property for Python.  It also tries to forward the development and use of Python.  But the PSF_ cannot do this without donations.  You can make a donation at http://python.org/psf/donations/ .  Every penny helps so even a small donation (you can donate through PayPal or by check) helps.

Summary Announcements
=====================
Sorry for the very late and short summary but I am in extreme crunch mode right now with school (partially thanks to a research paper comparing Python to Java) and preparing for applications to doctorate programs (any recommendations for schools with a good CS dept. and language research would be appreciated).  Don't expect things to pick up again until the quarter is over (Dec. 9th is my last final).

Summaries
=========
----------------------
New module: subprocess
----------------------
Peter Ã„strand wrote `PEP 324`_ to come up with a platform-independent way to create processes.  Originally entitled popen5, it has now been added to the stdlib as subprocess.

.. _PEP 324: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0324

Contributing threads:
  - `subprocess - updated popen5 module <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-October/049270.html>`__
  - `python/dist/src/Lib subprocess.py,NONE,1.1 <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-October/049361.html>`__

--------------------
Python 2.4.b1 is out
--------------------
`Python 2.4b1`_ has been released.  As usual please download it, run the test suite, and test it with your own code.

.. _Python 2.4b1: http://www.python.org/2.4/

Contributing threads:
  - `2.4b1 release, this Friday (AU time) -- imminent TRUNK FREEZING <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-October/049383.html>`__
  - `RELEASED Python 2.4, beta 1 <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-October/049452.html>`__
  - `TRUNK UNFROZEN (release is done) <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-October/049453.html>`__

--------------------------------------
We need a replacement for ConfigParser
--------------------------------------
David Goodger brought forward two patches for ConfigParser he wanted to apply.  This quickly brought up the point that ConfigParser's API is not exactly optimal.  So the decision was made to field new designs.  If you happen to have your own code lying around that handles .ini files nicely then get it cleaned up and consider proposing at as a replacement.

Some ideas have already been floated on the list but will have to wait for the next summary for mention/discussion.
