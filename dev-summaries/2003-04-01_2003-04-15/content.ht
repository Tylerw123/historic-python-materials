<h1 class="title">python-dev Summary for 2003-04-01 through 2003-04-15</h1>
<p>This is a summary of traffic on the <a class="reference" href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev">python-dev mailing list</a> from April 1, 2003 through April 15, 2003.  It is intended to inform the wider Python community of on-going developments on the list and to have an archived summary of each thread started on the list.  To comment on anything mentioned here, just post to <a class="reference" href="mailto:python-list&#64;python.org">python-list&#64;python.org</a> or <a class="reference" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.python">comp.lang.python</a> with a subject line mentioning what you are discussing. All python-dev members are interested in seeing ideas discussed by the community, so don't hesitate to take a stance on something.  And if all of this really interests you then get involved and join <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/dev/">python-dev</a>!</p>
<p>This is the fifteenth summary written by Brett Cannon (&lt;voice of Comic Book Guy from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&gt;Most summaries written by a single person, <em>ever</em> &lt;/voice&gt;).</p>
<p>All summaries are archived at <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/dev/summary/">http://www.python.org/dev/summary/</a> .</p>
<p>Please note that this summary is written using <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> which can be found at <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html">http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html</a> .  Any unfamiliar punctuation is probably markup for <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html">reST</a> (otherwise it is probably regular expression syntax or a typo =); you can safely ignore it, although I suggest learning reST; its simple and is accepted for <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0012">PEP markup</a>.  Also, because of the wonders of programs that like to reformat text, I cannot guarantee you will be able to run the text version of this summary through <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sf.net/">Docutils</a> as-is unless it is from the original text file.</p>

<p>So all three people who expressed an opinion about the new <a class="reference" href="#quickies">Quickies</a> format liked the new one, so it stays.</p>
<p>Do you guys actually like the links to the CVS in the Summaries?  The various links I put in to every single file mentioned that does not have direct documentation is time-consuming.  But if you find it useful it can stay.  Please let me know whether you actually use it (this means if you don't tell me!).</p>

<p>Do you want to know what dedication is?  Thinking of Python code that will cause Python to crash during dental surgery.  Well, Tim Peters is that dedicated and managed to come up with some code that crashed Python when it attempted to garbage-collect some objects.  This begins the joy that is garbage collection and finalizer functions.</p>
<p>Gather around, children, as we learn about how Python tries to keep you from having to worry about keeping track of your trash.  When Python executes the garbage collector, it looks to see what objects are unreachable based on reference counts; when something has a reference count of 0 nothing is referencing it so it is just floating out in the middle of no where with no one giving a hoot about whether it is their or not (children: &quot;Awww!  Poor, lonely object!&quot;).  But some of these lonely objects have what we call a finalizer (children: &quot;What's that?!?&quot;; isn't it cute when children are still inquisitive?  Good for you for still being inquisitive!  Have to be supportive, you know).  A finalizer is either an instance that has a __del__ object or an object that has something in its tp_del slot (children: &lt;nod&gt;).  Does anyone know why we have to take of these lonely objects that are somewhat special? (children: &lt;look around for someone to be brave enough to actually try to answer; no one does&gt;)  Well, since these objects have something that must be called before they are garbage-collected, we have to make sure they don't reference an object that is out there but people think is cared about when it is only an object with a finalizer and we don't care about their opinions; it might want to keep an object's reference count above 0 and thus not be collected (children: &quot;Oh...&quot;).  What makes them especially difficult to handle is that some objects that don't look like finalizers lie and end up acting like they are by defining a __getattr__ method that does very rude things (children: &quot;That's not nice!&quot;).  And since it is really hard to tell whether they are real finalizers or just act like one, we just let them be out there forever so that they don't make the great Interpreter have to deal with them (some rabble-rouser: &quot;My dad says that there is no great Interpreter and that everything came from the Compiler and Linker when they got together and did something my dad won't tell me about.  Something about the bits and the bees...&quot;; rest of children: &quot;Nu-uh!  The Interpeter is real!  We've seen it!  It's all-powerful and knowing!  Take it back, take it back!&quot;).  Luckily, though, it is only an issue with something old-timers call classic classes; things that started to decay away long, long ago(children: &quot;Yay!  No more cruft!&quot;)  And thanks to the diligent work of some very important people, it has been dealt with (children: &quot;Yay!  Thank you important people!&quot;).  There is a lesson to be learned here children; do not put old things to pasture to early since you can make stubborn old people mad which is bad since they make up the majority of voters in America (children: &quot;Yes, teacher!&quot;; smart-ass in the back of the room: &quot;How old are you, teacher?&quot; &lt;snicker&gt;).</p>
<p>Guido said that Python's cleanup model could be summed up as &quot;things get destroyed when nothing refers to them at some arbitrary time after nothing refers to them.&quot;  And the corollary is &quot;always explicitly close your external resources.&quot;  In other words, when nothing points to the object will get collected at <em>some</em> point, but not necessarily immediately.  The corollary is just good programming practice; close your resources yourself instead of relying on finalizers to do it for you since there is no guarantee when that will happen.</p>
<p>Tim Peters gave several suggestions in regards in how to make sure things get cleaned up; from registering cleanup code with sys.atexit() to keep a weakref in a module with a finalizer to be executed when the module is collected.</p>
